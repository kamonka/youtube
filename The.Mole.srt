It began when an unknown man from Denmark approached me with a proposition.

This is him in his tiny apartment in the outskirts of Copenhagen.

If this was a piece of fiction,no-one would believe that he would be meetingwith North Korean arms dealers in Africa...

You can walk in here no problem.

...or going to the North Korean embassy in Swedento pick up secret documents.

If something happened, embassy does know nothing about this.

Exactly.

But this is no fiction.

Everything you are about to see is real,and has been going on for more than ten years.

This is him aged 14, somewhere in Denmark.

He is celebrating his birthday.

Among the guests are children who grew up in the communist dictatorship East Germany.

Many years later, as a grown man, he will claim that befriending these kids and learning about the horrors of a totalitarian regime made him decide to infiltrate and expose the most brutal dictatorship of all...

..North Korea.

It's a nice explanation, but exactly why he chose to place himself in mortal danger is also beside the point.

What only matters here is that he is a mole.

In the end, I had to hire an expert to help me sort it out.

Annie Machon is a contentious figure in the intelligence world,but this does not concern me.

I am only interested in her skills in debriefing agents.

So, Annie, the mole arrived last night?

Mm-hm. And soon he's ready for you?

Do you have concerns?

Maybe...we should discuss that after you have met the mole.

Hi, Ulrich. I'm Annie.

Hi, Annie. Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you, too. Thank you.

I used to work for the British Security Service,otherwise known as MI5, and part of my job as an intelligence officer was to debrief agents.

So the film team has asked me in to debrief you about your life over the last ten years.

Yes.

Can you tell me a little bit more about him?

 His background?

Erm, you know, if he would rob a bank,you would not be able to describe him.

Mm-hm. Erm...

He blends in. He blends in. Perfect.

So, how did you get interested in North Korea?

Oh, it's a long story.

It is a long story, so I will speed it up.

Back in 2006, as a journalist from Denmark, I went to North Koreaand shot a documentary called The Red Chapel.

The regime in Pyongyang really hated my film,and because of that, I can never travel back to North Korea.

Seen from a western point of view, the film has its moments,but it does not offer up the smoking gun,the irrefutable proof that North Korea is an eviland criminal enterprise.

Ever since, I have been on a quest to prove these points,yet being forever banned from the Chamber of Secrets.

But back in Denmark, the man who I prefer to call the mole saw my film,and somehow it gave him the idea that he could travelto North Korea in my place.

Approximately ten years ago, out of nowhere, he wrote and askedif I would be interested in doing a film about himinfiltrating the Danish North Korean Friendship Association.

So... I mean, what happened?

Can you talk me through exactlythe first steps you took in this,and the sort of thought processyou were going through?

I told him it could be of interest if it would evolve to somethingof international importance,because the Danish North Korean Friendship Association in itselfis a fairly depressing group of people. Mm-hm.

He said, "Please keep me postedif it's interesting,"and I was like, "OK."I also told him, "I will never be able to pay you any money,"so that is not of importance for him,and then he just kept on going.

The mole went down the rabbit hole and discovered a bizarre worldof Danish senior citizens who are true friends of North Korea.

MAN SPEAKS DANISHSlowly but surely, the mole advanced in the hierarchyand became a member of the board,working under chairman Anders Kristensen,a die-hard communist.

Here you have him back in his heyday, meeting withthe founder of North Korea, Eternal President Kim Il-sung,grandfather of the current ruler, Kim Jong-un.

All the time, the mole was filming, the excuse being that he wasmaking movies for YouTube about his work as a board member.

So, how did things progress for youonce you were a member,and on the board?

The mole went to North Korea,and the North Koreans took a liking to him.

His main contact person in North Korea was a man named Kang,who works for the Ministry of Cultural Affairs.

Kang is a key person in this tale of deceit and intrigue.

Everywhere he went in North Korea, the mole was filming.

Of course, he also brought his camera when he was awarded a medal,recognising his work for the regime.

<font color="#00ff00">OK, congratulations.

Thank you.

So when did things really startto move?

Could you confirm thatthis is a photograph of him?

Amongst the friends of the regime in Pyongyang,Alejandro Cao de Benos is the biggest friend.

Compared to a small groupsuch as the Danish North Korean Friendship Association,the Korean Friendship Association is the international lodgefor people who consider North Korea to be heaven on Earth.

Alejandro Cao de Benos is the founderof the Korean Friendship Associationand is known around the world as the gatekeeper of North Korea.

As such, Alejandro Cao de Benos was my tour guide and access ticketwhen I travelled to North Korea back in 2006.

Here, we are posing for a North Korean newspaper.

Spending time with him, I found it hard to understand why Alejandro,who was born in Spain and lives in Spain,has chosen a life as a cheerleader for North Korea.

According to the UN, North Korea starves, abusesand kills its own citizens on a daily basis,but Alejandro Cao de Benos considers all that to be fake news.

I also discovered that his preferred foods are French pastry and candies,which is, I guess, the perfect diet for a supervillain.

Do you think Alejandro's dangerous?

APPLAUSEYou're a Spanish aristocratrepresenting the North Koreanregime. What's in it for you?

APPLAUSESo you meet him in Pyongyang,and then you go back to Europe,and then your second meetingis when you go to Spain. Yeah.

Can you tell me a little bitabout that meeting?

So what did Alejandro want from you?

And so the mole began channelling his way throughthe Korean Friendship Association, hoping to find the secretsof this global club for friends of Pyongyang.

Advised by me, the mole had a professional cameramanenrolled in KFA Denmark as his personal assistant.

Is Alejandro aware of thepersonal aspects of your life?

A lot of time because, in his real life, the mole is a retired chefwho lives on welfare subsidies from the governmentbecause of some sort of chronic diseasewhich prevents him from working.

He is married with children and resides in the suburbsof Copenhagen, living a seemingly normal life.

As such, he is the best mole you could ever want.

MUSIC PLAYSThat's quite a quick leap up.

So what were your responsibilitiesin that?

<font color="#00ff00">This is Ulrich out of Copenhagen.

<font color="#00ff00">Here's what he had to say.

<font color="#00ff00">So, Andre, he's really picking up<font color="#00ff00">on that theme<font color="#00ff00">that Dermot had about a smear<font color="#00ff00">against North Korea.

Do you happen to know if he's toldhis wife what he was doing?

I don't think so. Mm.

What did your wife say when you wenthome smelling of that strange scent?

Mm-hm.

LINE RINGSWhy does Alejandro like the mole?

What does he see in the mole?

Alejandro Cao de Benos begins putting pressure on the mole.

He wants him to source for businessmen who will investin North Korea.

So the main part, really, is raisingbusiness and investment. Yeah.

In a debriefing filmed in Denmark back in 2013,the mole was already talking about KFA president Alejandro Cao de Benoswanting him to find investors.

But investing in North Korea is tricky businessbecause of the tough UN sanctionslevelled against the cash-starved regime.

NEWSREEL:<font color="#00ff00"> The new sanctions<font color="#00ff00">include a ban on exports of<font color="#00ff00">North Korean goods such as machinery<font color="#00ff00">and electrical equipment.

Since no-one in their right mind would throw money at North Korea,I decided to invent a fake investor in order for the mole to find outwhat exactly Alejandro Cao de Benos had in mind.

I forgot to mention there is another person involved in this.

That person is Mr James.

His real name is Jim,and he was chosen by me to perform the role as Mr James,a man of international mystery.

In real life, Jim is a former member of the French Foreign Legionwho later went on to become a jetset cocaine pusher in Copenhagen.

In the end, he was caught and served eight years in jail,and now works and lives as a legitimate businessman.

In my mind, he was tailor-made for extreme role-playing.

So I had the mole invite Alejandro to come to Oslo in Norwayfor meeting with the man of his dreams,Mr James, a dapper Scandinavian oil billionaire.

So how did you set it up?

Mm-hm.

What kind of investments into North Koreawould President Alejandro Cao de Benos have on offer for Mr James?

Go.

KNOCK ON DOORSorry, just to interrupt,but what sort of cover storyhad you developed for James?

I mean, Alejandro presumably wouldhave done some checkingon the background of James.

So he didn't need to know the nameof this oil billionaire?

Did he discuss what types ofbusiness he would be looking for?

Meeting with President Alejandro Cao de Benos in Oslogave a whole new perspective on the Korean Friendship Associationbecause, officially, the KFA is a peaceful organisationwhich works to promote North Korean culture, history and valuesthrough its members in more than 30 different countries...

..including the official delegate for all of Scandinavia,the mole.

Was the KFA really being usedas a front for dealing with weapons and drugs from North Korea,with Alejandro as the spider in the web?

Or was Alejandro Cao de Benos playing us in order to get tothe deep pockets of Mr James?

And who was Alejandro really?

Simply a buffoonish braggart acting as a useful idiotfor the regime in Pyongyang?

Or was he a highly connected and sophisticatedinternational criminal?

At last, the mole had found his real mission and true purpose -follow the lead of Alejandro Cao de Benosand see where it takes us.

So, what happenedafter this meeting?

For the first time ever, the brave soldiers of the KFAwould have their annual meeting without their president -a perfect chance for the mole to rise in the ranks.

PHONE RINGSNext, the mole and Mr James went to Madrid in Spainto meet with Alejandro Cao de Benos.

Through me, Mr James had an order ready for North Korean weaponsas well as methamphetamine.

Would the president of the Korean Friendship Associationbe open for business,now that he was being investigated for arms trafficking?

So, Alejandro took James entirelyon trust, on your recommendation?

And what was that story?

So, at this meeting in Madrid...

Yeah.

..does James give any ideas aboutwhy he wants, why he's interestedin buying this sort of materiel?

At this point, he's stuck inSpain... Yeah. ..for legal reasons.

But he can organise your tripwith James to North Korea.

Going on a secret mission to North Koreacalls for careful planning,so I had my first in-person meeting with the mole and Mr James together,making sure that Mr James especiallyknew the most important rules of the game.

Hi, Jim. I'm Annie.

<font color="#00ff00">Pleasure to meet you.

Lovely to meet you, too.

If we can keep the answersas brief as possibleand as precise as possible,that would be appreciated.<font color="#00ff00"> Sure.

So, what was your perceptionof the possible risk at this point?

SHE LAUGHS<font color="#00ff00">Erm...

I was also worried for the mole.

Mr James had been around the block.

He could fend for himself.

But what about the mole?

He was just a retired chef.

So, I took him to see a teacher who could give him a crash coursein what is known as "tradecraft" among spies.

In short, I took him to see Max,a former CIA agent.

If he makes a mistake,he could find himself...

..tied up in the centre of townwith a blowtorch...

..as an examplefor nobody else to do that.

So...

But why trust a former CIA agentwith the identity and secrets of the mole?

 It's a good question.

Max had been fired from the Central Intelligence Agencyand was not in good standing with the company any more,which made it safer to trust him.

I'm going to kill you.

Why?

OK, yep.

Anyway, I was in need of someone who could teach the mole the ropesbefore he returned to North Korea.

If somebody's holding a gun on you,you're not going to expect themto...take it away.

All right?

 All you're looking foris a split-second edge.

And besides, as the saying goes,who can you trust these days?

Observation skills.

What I say, what's commonis common... Yeah.

..and what ain't, ain't.

That means if it's common,that's usual for the area,OK, that's normal.

If something stands out,it stands out for a reason,so you've got to be awareof your surroundings.

You might as well give themyour phone and say,"Here, look at it," becausethat's how easy it is nowadays.

You have to assume they can readall of your messages.

So, when they look atyour emails accounts,they can go way, way, way,way, way back.

They're going to feel likeyou betrayed them.

You didn't really believein...socialism or communism.

You didn't really believein North Korea as a place to go.

You didn't really believe it.

That was all just...

You were a mole.

Be careful that they don't seta trap for you.

So, like, when they walk out ofthe room and leave papers,don't touch them,don't go near them.

Then, they can say, "Oh, we knewhe was going to go through these."You don't care about those. Don'teven think about messing with that.

I tell you what, you are a heroof mine doing this.

It's very dangerous.

So, this is the real deal. Yeah.

Safe journey. Thank you, Max.

Godspeed. Thank you. Bye. Bye now.

Right in the middle of these anxieties,an American university student was arrested in North Korea.

NEWSREADER: ..was sentencedto hard labourfor stealing a propaganda poster.

The Warmbier...

His crime was simply stealing a posterfrom his hotel in Pyongyang.

So this is all on offer?

Yeah, this is what we were justhanded over the table.

Wow! So we've got Scud missiles?

Yeah.

So, you can get five Scud missilesfor $14 million.

Missile launchers. Yeah.

So we're going up to Scud-E missilesnow. Yeah. Good God.

$25 million.

Yeah.

And that's a high explosive warhead,and that's thermobaric. Oof!I mean, that's as closeas you can get to a nuke... Yeah.

..without it being a nuke.

What's this?

The arms factory?

 Yeah.

Yeah, OK.

All signed and sealed, as well. Yes.

And what was Ulrich doingduring this meetingwhen you were signing contracts?

He was allowed to film?

!CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS<font color="#00ff00">And where is that?

At this point, you're in a secretunderground lair in North Korea,facilitating the signatureof a weapons contract.

What is going through your headat this stage?

APPLAUSEAnd Alejandro is awareof all of this?

MUSIC PLAYSAPPLAUSEAnd did the Koreans haveany preferenceswhen it came to countries,or suggestions?

So, to sum it up,you are now a North Koreanweapons dealer and broker?

<font color="#00ff00">Yes.

NEWSREADER: Good evening, and it'sgreat to have you with us hereon a Monday night. And we beginwith late developments today,the worsening horror fora mother and father from Ohio.

Their son, who was just returnedfrom North Koreawith severe brain damage,has now died.

Since the moment their sonwas sentencedto hard labour for stealinga propaganda poster,the Warmbiers were fightinguntil he was released.

<font color="#00ff00">The look in his eyes, which I didn't<font color="#00ff00">know he was blind at the time,<font color="#00ff00">was absolute horror -<font color="#00ff00">horror like he'd seen the devil.

<font color="#00ff00">And he had. He was with the devil.

Back in Copenhagen, I was shocked to discover what my two proxieshad accomplished in Pyongyang.

They had brought real, raw intelligence with them.

As the scholar Andrea Berger writes in her study Target Markets,very little is known about pricing on North Korean weapons systems,but here was a fully detailed menu in hard copy.

Mr James being appointed as a North Korean arms brokerseemed like the figment of a sick mind,but here also was a signed and sealed contract,drawn up in English by the North Koreans.

Before Mr James came along, only a few non-Koreanshad been known to broker weapons for the regime in Pyongyang.

Back in 2011, the British arms dealer Michael Ranger was arrestedfor brokering a deal between Azerbaijan and North Korea,but he was a highly experienced arms dealer in a dangerous gamefor experts, let alone amateurs.

Nevertheless, Mr James and the mole had scored a jackpot.

RUSTLINGZIPPER ZIPSTo prepare the mole for his next mission, Alejandro would now provideguidance on how to operate as a businessman in Uganda.

OK.

OK.

Oh, OK.

You were mic'd up?

 You had a volunteer, ten years ago, saying he could infiltrate a North Korean Friendship group in Denmark.
 You said that wasn't really big enough for you to investigate, but you'd stay in contact and if it became bigger, then you could revisit it.
 It did.
 I used to work for the British security service, otherwise known as MI5, so the film team has asked me in to debrief you.
 He is a retired chef.
 Mm-hm.
 He resides in the suburbs of Copenhagen, together with his family.
 Do you happen to know if he's told his wife what he was doing?
 I don't think so.
 No?
 And, over those early years, your mole had progressed up the hierarchy of the North Korean Friendship Association until he was a position of influence in Europe and knew the head guy in Europe.
 Do you think Alejandro is dangerous?
 You brought in a fake businessman.
 He has to play the part of Mr James.
 And suddenly the North Koreans get very excited about the possibility of weapons trading, or drug smuggling, or whatever.
 And deals are cut, contracts are signed.
 So, what I want to think about is where does that leave us now?
 And did the Koreans have any preferences when it came to countries or suggestions?
 The mole speaks about how they are going to produce methamphetamine and weapons, and then Alejandro Cao de Benos says.
.
.
 DETECTOR BEEPS I knew, if something is going to happen here, it's over.
 BEEPING HE SCOFFS BEEPING CONTINUES CAR STARTS HE EXHALES What happened next?
 HE GROANS So, just to be fully clear here, he was fully briefed on the plans to build the secret factory in Uganda?
 Loved the idea.
 OK.
Yeah.
 In Uganda, Mr James would be the playmaker.
 Yeah, OK.
 And to have it all on camera, he brought a photographer who was filming for a covert video about his life as a man of international mystery.
 And the mole, he brought his hidden camera.
 So, what happens next?
 Is that.
.
.
?
 And who is he?
 NEWSCASTER: Earlier this month, North Korea threatened to fire missiles towards the US territory of Guam.
 This provoked the US president into threats of war.
 North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States.
 They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
 LAUGHTER How had you found the island in the first place?
 LAUGHTER EXCITED CHATTER MAN:We are waiting for someone.
 Your sister?
 Your brother?
 MAN: I will show you one on the other side and then we are done, and then you have an idea of all the things.
 Did you get an impression that they had something out of the box, so they had done this before and had a standard plan, a standard look for disguising these sort of facilities?
 They had worked with other people like this?
 How can that be done?
 Was the government involved?
 We were really crazy as well.
 Thank you.
 APPLAUSE GROANING LAUGHTER THUMPING MUSIC PLAYS So, although the true purpose of the project was not revealed to the Africans, buying the island in Uganda and using it for a secret weapons and drug factory seemed to be right up the alley of the North Koreans, which was kind of important to prove.
 But it did not stop there because, while in Uganda, the North Korean arms dealer Mr Danny was ready to take the joint venture a step further.
 Yeah, we can meet in the lobby.
 North Koreans needing to move armaments to Syria is actually a very interesting piece of information, so please allow me to digress a little bit.
 Historically, North Korea and Syria have been friends for many years and the North Koreans were even building a nuclear reactor in the Syrian desert until the Israelis decided to blow it up.
 During the civil war in Syria, the New York Times published a story about how North Korea was helping the Syrian regime with its chemical weapons programme.
 At the same time, small arms from North Korea have been found in the hands of fighters from the Islamic State, but most likely these weapons were stolen from the Syrian army.
 So, when the North Korean arms dealer Mr Danny wants to send bombs and projectiles to Syria, the end user is probably the Syrian regime.
 So what did you say to Danny when he suggested that you help with the Syria move?
 Something I still feel bad about is sending Mr James to Beijing to meet with North Korean arms dealers.
 People who are in the know about the dark side advised us strongly against it.
 Because if the Chinese intelligence service would shine their lights on Mr James, it would be another ball game entirely.
 But Mr James is a man who craves action and I am a film-maker who craves sensation, so he went anyway.
 Both men are North Korean.
 I know this because sometimes they speak Korean to each other in the dialect of the North.
 Asking for names of clients and contacts in the world of arms dealing seems to be a show stopper.
 And what was the power dynamic between these two?
 Was the enigmatic Stoneface summoned to Beijing in order to verify the identity of Mr James?
 He never says a word, he does not even smile, so we can never know for sure about Stoneface, but it is safe to say that his appearance made a difference.
 Yeah.
 HE LAUGHS HE LAUGHS LOUDLY So, when did they contact you again?
 Hm.
 My actor, Mr James, seemed to be taking on a life of his own.
 That was a concern.
 Another concern was the mole going back to Spain to brief Alejandro Cao de Benos about the Tourism Project, the code name chosen for the underground weapons and drugs factory in Uganda.
 By now, the mole had been undercover for more than seven years and paranoia was running high.
 So far, no intelligence service had caught onto us, but, every time we met with Alejandro Cao de Benos, we had to consider the possibility that he was being followed by spooks.
 At the same time, we also had to consider the risk that Alejandro would upgrade his counter surveillance with new devices for discovering microphones.
 From now on, the mole would only meet with Alejandro in a hotel chosen by us with security on standby next door in case his cover was blown.
 Soon Alejandro would spring another surprise on the mole, but first a piece of nostalgia.
 You see, going to North Korea with Alejandro as my tour guide back in 2006 left a long-lasting impression on me.
 Apparently I had also left a long-lasting impression on Alejandro Cao de Benos and so had my first documentary about North Korea, The Red Chapel.
 The film stars two Danish-Korean comedians who go to Pyongyang and lampoon the leadership, which means that I am not Mr Popular in North Korea any more.
 HE SPEAKS ANOTHER LANGUAGE Sarcasm aside, Alejandro Cao de Benos is a man who thinks big.
 During the meeting in Barcelona, Alejandro tells the mole of an ambitious plan for a triangle deal involving Mr James, North Korea and a Jordanian businessman.
 Which is...?

 If the mole could get Mr James to Spain, Alejandro will introduce him to his plans for triangular trading.
 HE COUGHS AND LAUGHS Hmm.
 LAUGHTER So my two proxies, the mole and Mr James, went to Jordan to find out if there really is a man named El Dasouki who wants to triangle with them and North Korea.
 Have a nice day.
 BELL RINGS I guess that's the food.
 Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
 ANNIE: So was the contract actually signed?
 They signed the contract.
 For how much?
 NAME BLEEPED OUT Here, El Dasouki mentions a major Jordanian power broker, but, due to legal reasons, his name cannot be disclosed.
 Next, the mole was asked to go to Sweden because a package was waiting for him to be picked up at the North Korean embassy in Stockholm.
 Like my sort of movie! So.

 Thank you for the ride.
 Then, in this tale of intrigue and deception, a new character made his appearance.
 It was Mr Ju, a North Korean envoy who came to Copenhagen to do business with Mr James.
 Last time the world met Mr Ju was on the Australian version of 60 Minutes, where he acts as a smiling mouthpiece for the regime in Pyongyang.
 LAUGHTER And did Alejandro know about this deal as well?
 Now the North Koreans would discover that Denmark also is a very alcoholised country.
 Chin-chin! Had Mr James chosen to honour the contract he signed in Copenhagen, he would have to wire millions of dollars to El Dasouki in Jordan as payment for oil to North Korea.
 In return, North Korea would deliver manpower and products to the island of Mr James and so goes the triangle trade.
 From his office in Jordan, El Dasouki was now threatening legal action unless Mr James honoured their contract and showed him the money.
 Meanwhile, the North Korean weapons dealer, Mr Danny, who we met in Uganda, was pushing for a meeting with Mr James in order to "speed up" the business.
 They met in a hotel in Cambodia, where Mr James was taken to the next level in the circle of trust.
 GUNSHOTS In Cambodia, it became apparent that the sanctions are working.
 The North Koreans are desperate to find clients who will buy their weapons and it seems like Mr James is their big white hope.
 And what about the triangulation deal?
 Where's that left at the moment?
 So this is where you left it?
Yeah.
 They still trust you.
 But not for long.
 The investigation had gone as far as it could, so Mr James had to disappear.
 Thanks to my intervention, Mr James went off the grid and simply vanished, no longer answering his phone nor his emails.
 In short, Mr James became a ghost.
 Meanwhile, the mole was taking care of business as the KFA delegate of Scandinavia.
 First, he went to London to protest against the BBC, together with his comrade in arms, the British delegate of the Korean Friendship Association, Mr Dermot Hodgson.
 Then the mole went to Spain for his last in-person meeting with his president, Alejandro Cao de Benos.
 Several items were on the agenda.
 And old carpets on the floor.
 But most important was the sudden disappearance of Mr James.
 To top it off, the mole had been chosen as the host of the annual KFA meeting.
 It was I who wrote the speeches for the mole and now he would deliver his final sermon.
 As I had planned it, the mole would share the fruits of the top-secret work he had been doing with his mentor Alejandro.
 Following the annual KFA meeting, one member of the Korean Friendship Association praised the Tourist Project on the message board of the KFA.
 Alejandro told the mole to delete everything at once.
 Also, a member named Jean Paul left the KFA because he panicked about spying and hacking.
 At the end of this, I hired the former intelligence officer Annie Machon.
 Before she went rogue and became a whistle-blower, she was working for the British security service, the MI5.
 Her exploits as a whistle-blower have made her controversial, but that is of no concern to me.
 I am only interested in her qualifications as a spy.
 Running long-time undercover agents was her line of work, as was debriefing agents at the end of their missions.
 If someone has put ten years of their life into doing something, and they've been very solitary in what they're doing, they do need a chance just to tell someone exactly what they went through.
 It's almost like a confessional.
 And, of course, you do want to, to reward them at the end of it, even if it's just with a recognition they can't really tell anyone about, apart from perhaps their wife or their husband.
 But it is that recognition that's very important when they've been working undercover for so long.
 Such as a lavish dinner?
 A lavish dinner usually works very well, yes.
 And I want to raise a toast to you both for what you have achieved.
 I think it's probably the.
.
.
 .
.
most impressive private intelligence operation I've ever heard of.
 How are you going to protect these two guys from any reprisals from the North Koreans?
 Regarding Mr James, he simply refuses to be.
.
.
 SHE LAUGHS .
.
you know.
.
.
protected or advised about security.
 OK.
 Erm, we have prepared for an after-care programme for the mole, also taking care of his security.
 Mm-hm.
 And his family?
 And his family as well.
 Erm.
.
.
 What I am more concerned about regarding the mole is that being the mole has been a part of his identity for more than ten years, you know?
 So, what will happen when we bring him in?
 Entering any form of secret-type world is very seductive - I know from personal experience.
