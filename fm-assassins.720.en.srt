okay speaking on camera?</i>

2
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:01,811
<i>So we can show you as Siti's friend?</i>

3
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:07,204
But I want to protect my identity.
What if people say,

4
00:01:07,558 --> 00:01:11,866
"That girl is the friend of a murderer"?

5
00:01:20,022 --> 00:01:22,566
<i>We were friends. We liked to hang out.</i>

6
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,072
<i>We liked talking, eating, shopping.</i>

7
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:30,921
Hi.

8
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:35,027
<i>Siti's really pretty and down to earth.</i>

9
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:37,219
Somebody is having a baby...

10
00:01:40,154 --> 00:01:43,551
<i>She was always making jokes.</i>

11
00:01:44,477 --> 00:01:48,480
<i>She's friendly and "happy go lucky."</i>

12
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:50,729
Thank you. Buh-bye.

00:01:53,097 --> 00:01:57,183
This is her last Facebook post.

The night before the murder,

15
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:06,359
Siti celebrated her
birthday at Hard Rock Cafe.

<i>Malaysian police said

<i>was the deadly VX nerve agent.</i>

<i>was an assassination organized

42
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:42,733
<i>But North Korea
denies involvement in the crime.</i>

43

<i>or innocent pawns of

47
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,293
<i>I started covering the
Kim Jong-nam murder trial</i>

48
00:04:33,747 --> 00:04:36,173
<i>from day one, when the first news broke.</i>

49
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:43,026
<i>A reporter's job is to
tell the world the truth.</i>

50
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:47,592
<i>But in Malaysia,
the freedom of press is limited.</i>

51
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:51,900
Most of the big media agencies

52
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:54,611
are owned by the government.

53
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:58,126
<i>So, it's hard to get the truth out.</i>

54
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:07,394
<i>But, I am lucky that my media
organization is not a local one.</i>

55
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,320
<i>So we are quite open
with what we can publish.</i>

56
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:17,120
<i>It's one of those big stories that is a
dream for a reporter to report on.</i>

57
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:23,074
So around 9 AM, Kim Jong-nam walked

58
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:25,764
through this entrance to the terminal.

59
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:30,552
<i>He was just alone. No one was with him.</i>

60
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:38,320
And right behind this column,

61
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:40,860
there was one woman waiting for him.

62
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:43,725
<i>This is Siti Aisyah,</i>

63
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:46,384
<i>the woman in a light gray shirt.</i>

64
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:49,451
<i>And from that way,</i>

65
00:05:50,657 --> 00:05:52,918
<i>Doan Thi Huong was coming towards him.</i>

66
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:56,104
<i>She was wearing a white
T-shirt that says "LOL."</i>

67
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,180
<i>So he was supposed to print
out his boarding pass,</i>

68
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:03,309
<i>but before he was able to do that,</i>

69
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:05,657
<i>Kim Jong-nam was jumped
by Siti Aisyah and Doan.</i>

70
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:11,616
<i>And they allegedly smeared
VX chemical onto his face.</i>

71
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,740
<i>The women ran away.</i>

72
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:21,140
<i>And then from the CCTV footage you
can clearly see that Kim Jong-nam was</i>

73
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:23,575
<i>making this gesture to police officers</i>

74
00:06:23,576 --> 00:06:26,973
<i>that these two women came up
to smear his face with a chemical.</i>

75
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:33,709
<i>And from there the police officers
escorted Kim Jong-nam towards the clinic.</i>

76
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:37,538
<i>You can see that he is starting to limp,</i>

77
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,015
<i>like he has already been
affected by something.</i>

78
00:06:41,713 --> 00:06:43,713
<i>He was given medical attention,</i>

79
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:47,255
<i>but within an hour, he was dead.</i>

80
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:57,536
<i>Meanwhile, the two women,</i>

81
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,780
<i>they both went down to
level 2 to the toilet</i>

82
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:02,323
<i>to wash their hands.</i>

83
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:04,494
<i>It seems to suggest that</i>

84
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:07,768
<i>they knew that the chemical on their hands</i>

85
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,693
<i>is something dangerous.</i>

86
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,241
<i>They have a certain</i>

87
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:19,953
<i>cool, calculative</i>

88
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,315
<i>confidence in their walk.</i>

89
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:28,688
Here is what I find interesting, because

90
00:07:29,412 --> 00:07:31,828
she's walking and then she...

91
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,737
<i>she looked into the CCTV camera.</i>

92
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,609
<i>As if challenging, you know?</i>

93
00:07:41,214 --> 00:07:43,131
Yeah, I just did that. So what?

94
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:45,769
<i>Well, one thing is clear.</i>

95
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:48,992
<i>This is one of the most bizarre
murder plots in decades.</i>

96
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:51,925
<i>It really is incredible,
when you look at this woman,</i>

97
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,009
<i>who is acting in broad daylight.</i>

98
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,468
<i>Who are these women,</i>

99
00:07:55,493 --> 00:07:57,633
<i>and do they work
for the North Korean regime?</i>

100
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:07,519
<i>Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong</i>

101

105
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:21,997
I didn't know at first.

106
00:08:20,397 --> 00:08:23,020
ASRIA NUR HASAN:

107
00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:26,115
I was at prayer.

108
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,079
Praying.

109
00:08:32,143 --> 00:08:36,382
<i>Reciting Qur'an at a funeral.
A friend had died.</i>

110
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:47,369
<i>And then I found out.</i>

111
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:51,877
I felt,

112
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:55,204
how could I, as a parent...

113
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:57,045
it felt like...

114
00:08:57,552 --> 00:09:04,145
how could something like this happen?

115
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:08,628
What could have brought
her to do such a thing?

116
00:09:09,993 --> 00:09:13,654
<i>I think she didn't know what she was doing.</i>

117
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:18,131
<i>If I asked her to do something,</i>

118
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:21,564
<i>she would do it.</i>

119
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,730
That's the kind of person she is.

120
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,823
I've never actually seen
this photo.

121
00:09:39,988 --> 00:09:41,088
Wow.

122
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:47,812
<i>My obsession with North Korea
goes back a long way.</i>

123
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:51,691
<i>I started covering North Korea
in 2004.</i>

124
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,251
<i>And I have not stopped yet.</i>

125
00:09:54,818 --> 00:09:56,994
<i>So, when the assassination
happened,</i>

126
00:09:57,132 --> 00:10:00,687
I came out of a yoga class, it
was like nine o'clock at night,

127
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:02,112
and I looked at my phone

128
00:10:02,137 --> 00:10:04,622
<i>and saw it had blown up.</i>

129
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,790
<i>Kim Jong-nam has been
assassinated.</i>

130
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:10,582
<i>Kim Jong-nam, at one point,
was the favorite son of Kim Jong-il,</i>

131
00:10:10,607 --> 00:10:12,227
<i>the former leader of
North Korea.</i>

132
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:15,180
<i>He has been known as
a potential rival for Kim Jong-un.</i>

133
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:17,536
And it's raising suspicions
that Kim Jong-un

134
00:10:17,561 --> 00:10:21,150
may have once again marked one
of his own relatives for death.

135
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:24,886
<i>It was so surprising to
me, you know, the footage,</i>

136
00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:27,999
<i>to see Kim Jong-nam
standing in this airport.</i>

137
00:10:28,136 --> 00:10:30,049
<i>I mean, it's so amazing
to think, you know,</i>

138
00:10:30,074 --> 00:10:33,194
<i>I was trying to find Kim Jong-nam for
several years before he was killed,</i>

139
00:10:33,219 --> 00:10:37,216
<i>and just to see him walking
around, no hat, no sunglasses.</i>

140
00:10:38,162 --> 00:10:41,376
<i>It's really like, wow, I wish I
had have been able to talk to him.</i>

141
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:47,758
<i>And there's this myth
that the Kim family</i>

142
00:10:47,822 --> 00:10:50,538
<i>was descended from Mount Paektu,</i>

143
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:53,291
<i>which is this mountain
at the top of North Korea</i>

144
00:10:53,316 --> 00:10:54,889
<i>on the border with China,</i>

145
00:10:54,914 --> 00:10:57,757
<i>that is the mythical home
of all Korean people.</i>

146
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:03,612
<i>And so the Kim regime
has used this to say,</i>

147
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:07,183
<i>"We were divinely ordained
to lead North Korea,"</i>

148
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,204
<i>and it's called
the Paektu bloodline.</i>

149
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:15,348
<i>So Kim Il-sung passed down
the leadership of North Korea</i>

150
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:17,961
<i>to his son, Kim Jong-il,</i>

151
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:20,644
<i>using this whole Paektu
bloodline mythology</i>

152
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:22,902
<i>as the basis for his legitimacy.</i>

153
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:25,673
<i>So when it came time
for Kim Jong-il</i>

154
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:27,458
<i>to anoint one of his sons,</i>

155
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:29,991
<i>it should have gone
to Kim Jong-nam.</i>

156
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:32,389
<i>Are you Kim Jong-nam?</i>

157
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:34,694
<i>- Are you Kim Jong-nam?</i>
- No.

158
00:11:35,349 --> 00:11:36,661
I cannot tell you.

159
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:39,475
It's my privacy, man.

160
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,498
<i>Kim Jong-nam was the
first-born son of Kim Jong-il.</i>

161
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:49,765
<i>And, in fact,
Kim Jong-nam's mother</i>

162
00:11:49,882 --> 00:11:53,472
<i>was a famous actress
who Kim Jong-il spotted</i>

163
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,996
<i>and took her basically
as his wife.</i>

164
00:11:57,211 --> 00:12:00,179
<i>But Kim Jong-il really doted
on Kim Jong-nam.</i>

165
00:12:00,598 --> 00:12:02,738
<i>He was absolutely besotted
with this boy</i>

166
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:07,341
<i>and really seemed to relish his
time as a father at the beginning.</i>

167
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,699
<i>Kim Jong-nam and Kim Jong-un
grew up entirely separate.</i>

168
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,601
<i>They had different mothers.</i>

169
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:23,655
<i>And there's a 10-year
age difference.</i>

170
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:28,302
<i>Kim Jong-un's mother was another
woman, she was a famous dancer,</i>

171
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:31,787
<i>and was very ambitious
and very present.</i>

172
00:12:32,313 --> 00:12:34,542
<i>She was advocating and agitating</i>

173
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:38,155
for her son, for him to be
the leader of North Korea,

174
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:41,305
and she had a very powerful
influence in the system there.

175
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,959
<i>So, at the beginning
of the 2000s,</i>

176
00:12:48,984 --> 00:12:53,486
<i>Kim Jong-nam was caught in this
very embarrassing situation.</i>

177
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:58,106
<i>He had taken
his young family to Tokyo</i>

178
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:01,026
<i>and was busted
by the Japanese police.</i>

179
00:13:01,632 --> 00:13:05,412
<i>He'd gone in under a fake
Dominican Republic passport,</i>

180
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:09,819
<i>using a Chinese name, Pang
Xiong, which means "fat bear."</i>

181
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:14,045
And he said, you know, he just
wanted to take his kid to Disneyland.

182
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:18,620
<i>It was extremely embarrassing
for the regime.</i>

183
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:21,967
<i>America is North Korea's
number-one enemy</i>

184
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:27,301
<i>and Disneyland, you know,
can you get more American than Disneyland?</i>

185
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,335
<i>But, in fact, there were rumors</i>

186
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,124
<i>that Kim Jong-un's mother actually
tipped off the Japanese police</i>

187
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,766
<i>to the arrival of Kim Jong-nam
in Japan</i>

188
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:39,805
<i>because she wanted to make sure</i>

189
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,425
<i>that he could not become the
next leader of North Korea.</i>

190
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,852
<i>So, Kim Jong-nam struck
a deal with his father</i>

191
00:13:48,877 --> 00:13:51,220
<i>to be allowed to leave
North Korea.</i>

192
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:56,173
<i>He moved to Macau,
a Chinese territory,</i>

193
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,867
<i>where he was able to live
a kind of normal life.</i>

194
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:04,040
<i>But he was ruled out
of the succession line.</i>

195
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,798
<i>And throughout history,
we've seen</i>

196
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:10,523
brothers being sidelined

197
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:11,864
in this way.

198
00:14:12,923 --> 00:14:17,928
<i>From Cain and Abel to Romulus and
Remus at the foundation of Rome.</i>

199
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:20,474
<i>Brothers are so threatening</i>

200
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:23,558
<i>because they can stake a claim
to leadership</i>

201
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,447
<i>that nobody else can.</i>

202
00:14:27,753 --> 00:14:31,380
<i>So, when I discovered that
Kim Jong-nam had been killed,</i>

203
00:14:31,518 --> 00:14:35,013
I hopped on the first flight
that I could get to Kuala Lumpur.

204
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:43,738
Good morning, everyone.

205
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:47,418
Welcome to the foreign journalists,

206
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:49,403
welcome to Malaysia as well.

207
00:14:49,938 --> 00:14:51,769
We have arrested two ladies,

208
00:14:51,794 --> 00:14:54,876
and we have identified both of them.

209
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,478
<i>The Malaysian police announced that they have
arrested Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong.</i>

210
00:15:02,272 --> 00:15:05,172
<i>They also announced there were
eight North Korean suspects.</i>

211
00:15:06,295 --> 00:15:09,972
<i>And out of those eight,
four of them were at the airport</i>

212
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:12,082
<i>on the same day as Siti Aisyah and Doan,</i>

213
00:15:12,107 --> 00:15:16,527
<i>And they left the country immediately
after Kim Jong-nam's attack.</i>

214
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,615
<i>And then, they also announced the arrest of</i>

215
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,496
<i>one North Korean guy,</i>

216
00:15:21,682 --> 00:15:23,975
<i>Ri Jong Choi.
who was living in Malaysia</i>

217
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,960
and he happens to be a chemist.

218
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:31,627
<i>Ri Jong Choi,
the suspect that was detained...</i>

219
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:36,807
<i>Can you clear up, because there are rumors that
he was the driver or he was a chemistry expert...</i>

220
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:40,840
He is subject of our investigation.
How can we tell you?

221
00:15:41,396 --> 00:15:43,220
<i>We found out that Ri Jong Choi is</i>

222
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:45,356
on the payroll of the North Korean embassy.

223
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:51,580
<i>He lives in a house paid by the North
Korean government in Kuala Lumpur.</i>

224
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:54,876
<i>I was just wondering...</i>

225
00:15:55,323 --> 00:15:56,989
<i>the two female suspects,</i>

226
00:15:57,014 --> 00:16:00,056
<i>did they know the substance was toxic?</i>

227
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:02,671
Well, I think you have
seen the video, right?

228
00:16:02,824 --> 00:16:04,712
<i>You have seen the -</i>

229
00:16:04,737 --> 00:16:08,695
the lady who was moving away
with her hands like this,

230
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,842
towards the bathroom. Towards the washroom.

231
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,731
So she knew very well that

232
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:16,597
it is toxic and she
needs to wash her hands.

233
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,373
Hello.

234
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,026
Yes, speaking.

235
00:16:39,576 --> 00:16:40,673
Yes.

236
00:16:41,452 --> 00:16:44,599
Because our theory is that this was
a political assassination.

237
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,840
More than just the two girls being involved

238
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:49,992
in an ordinary murder case.

239
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:56,326
<i>Well, we do not know exactly what type of
evidence the police have in hand.</i>

240
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:02,524
<i>When we approach any case,</i>

241
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:04,882
<i>we will not accept what
our client tells us.</i>

242
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:09,181
We will investigate on our own and see
whether our client is telling the truth.

243
00:17:14,726 --> 00:17:20,105
<i>After Siti Aisyah was arrested,
we saw her the very next day.</i>

244
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:25,012
<i>And there in prison, there were
other inmates who told her that,</i>

245
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:27,476
"You are going to be the next 'BA.'"

246
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:28,864
"BA" is the -

247
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:30,366
banduan akhir.

248
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,242
That means on death row.

249
00:17:32,243 --> 00:17:33,858
You are going to be the next one.

250
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,958
<i>In Malaysia, if they're found guilty,</i>

251
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:41,293
<i>then it's a mandatory death sentence.</i>

252
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,620
That is hanging by the
neck until you are dead.

253
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:47,107
They will put a sandbag,

254
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,147
which would be sufficient to snap
your neck immediately when...

255
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,213
You will die instantaneously.

256
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,252
Okay, all right, then.
I will check that. Thank you.

257
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:07,136
We advised her to be very careful

258
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,925
not to talk about her story to anyone,

259
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,075
even Doan.

260
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:14,263
<i>Because we don't know Doan's story.</i>

261
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:16,467
<i>The girls don't know each other,</i>

262
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:18,634
<i>and we don't know whether Doan is</i>

263
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:21,321
<i>working together with the North Koreans.</i>

264
00:18:31,828 --> 00:18:34,381
Not bad, eh?
I can get the documents I want.

265
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:38,085
Very organized.

266
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,633
Okay, this is quite clear.

267
00:18:42,786 --> 00:18:44,113
The victim is here.

268
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:47,610
And then I think the
incident takes place...

269
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,113
Okay, this is on the day
of the incident itself.

270
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,948
This is her action of putting
up the hands like that.

271
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:56,186
And that is the crucial moment.

272
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:02,243
<i>I first met Doan in prison.</i>

273
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:08,583
<i>There were two officers from
the Vietnamese embassy and myself.</i>

274
00:19:09,341 --> 00:19:11,250
<i>And when she was brought to us,</i>

275
00:19:12,071 --> 00:19:14,898
<i>she was happy to see
officers of the embassy,</i>

276
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:17,158
<i>who could speak her own language.</i>

277
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,287
She was hopeful then at that point of time.

278
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:49,418
<i>These are all the certificates Doan
has earned since she was little.</i>

279
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,135
<i>She was always well-behaved,
a good student.</i>

280
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:01,350
<i>Nothing troublesome.</i>

281
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:08,560
<i>We are farmers, my parents were farmers.</i>

282
00:20:09,988 --> 00:20:12,279
<i>Doan's mother passed away three years ago,</i>

283
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:14,008
<i>before all this happened.</i>

284
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,300
<i>Doan was a good girl.</i>

285
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:25,541
<i>She was even terrified
of butchering a chicken.</i>

286
00:20:26,918 --> 00:20:30,017
<i>She wouldn't dare kill it.
I always had to do it for her.</i>

287
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:36,241
<i>She went to Hanoi for
college a few years ago.</i>

288
00:20:38,506 --> 00:20:41,852
I think the world out there seduced her.

289
00:20:49,638 --> 00:20:52,278
<i>When suddenly this happened,</i>

290
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:56,031
everybody in the family was shocked.

291
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:06,511
<i>I sent her a letter encouraging her
that if she did do it,</i>

292
00:21:06,694 --> 00:21:08,361
<i>she should confess it.</i>

293
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:12,189
Whatever she did or however it happened,

294
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:14,835
only she knows.

295
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:19,190
<i>We love her very much,
but we don't know how to help her.</i>

296
00:21:33,757 --> 00:21:36,217
<i>It has been seven days since the incident.</i>

297
00:21:36,488 --> 00:21:41,514
There is an allegation that the
arrested female suspects murdered him.

298
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:46,285
<i>The Malaysian police are desperate
to shift the blame on us.</i>

299
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:50,340
<i>Last Friday night,
they raided the condominium</i>

300
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:53,819
<i>of our citizen here in Kuala Lumpur</i>

301
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,126
<i>and forcibly arrested him.</i>

302
00:21:56,823 --> 00:21:58,651
<i>The North Korean ambassador in Malaysia</i>

303
00:21:58,676 --> 00:22:00,260
<i>held a press conference</i>

304
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:01,896
<i>talking about Ri Jong Chol,</i>

305
00:22:02,313 --> 00:22:04,887
<i>the North Korean chemist who was arrested.</i>

306
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:07,700
<i>This is a grave human rights violation.</i>

307
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,762
<i>Saying that they have distrust
in the Malaysian police investigation.</i>

308
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:14,382
<i>Malaysia reacted</i>

309
00:22:16,756 --> 00:22:19,222
<i>by expelling the North Korean ambassador.</i>

310
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:24,135
<i>From there, North Korea issued a ban</i>

311
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:27,123
<i>on Malaysians leaving North Korea.</i>

312
00:22:27,952 --> 00:22:30,975
So all these people who are
embassy staff and their families,

313
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,751
they are trapped in North Korea.

314
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:35,345
So they are basically hostages.

315
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:40,162
<i>And then, in March,</i>

316
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:43,795
<i>Malaysia and North Korea
actually had a negotiation.</i>

317
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:47,232
<i>North Korea demanded the
release of Ri Jong Choi,</i>

318
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,953
<i>as well as the release of two suspects</i>

319
00:22:49,978 --> 00:22:52,401
<i>who were hiding in the
North Korean embassy.</i>

320
00:22:53,273 --> 00:22:55,781
<i>They are a North Korean embassy official</i>

321
00:22:55,806 --> 00:23:00,608
<i>and an employee of Air Koryo,
the North Korean national airline.</i>

322
00:23:01,508 --> 00:23:04,343
<i>They also demanded the body of Kim Jong-nam</i>

323
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:07,116
<i>to be sent back to North Korea.</i>

324
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,312
<i>After years in exile,</i>

325
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:12,424
<i>the murdered half-brother
of North Korea's dictator</i>

326
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,009
<i>has finally gone home.</i>

327
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:16,723
<i>It's a clean sweep
tonight for Kim Jong-un.</i>

328
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:19,411
<i>North Korea's dangerous young
leader has gotten the body</i>

329
00:23:19,436 --> 00:23:21,880
<i>of his murdered half-brother
Kim Jong-nam.</i>

330
00:23:22,107 --> 00:23:24,541
<i>And Malaysia has released
three North Koreans</i>

331
00:23:24,566 --> 00:23:26,574
<i>wanted for questioning
in the murder.</i>

332
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:29,051
<i>Chaos at Beijing's
airport Friday</i>

333
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:32,889
<i>as North Korean Ri Jong Chol
made his way through the crowd.</i>

334
00:23:33,222 --> 00:23:36,512
<i>Ri was released and then
deported by Malaysian authorities</i>

335
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:38,351
<i>after being held as a suspect</i>

336
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:42,345
<i>in the murder of North Korean leader
Kim Jong-un's estranged half-brother.</i>

337
00:23:42,405 --> 00:23:44,656
It was very difficult to
bear but I said to myself

338
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:47,131
that I must get through this,

339
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:51,014
because I cannot let them do this
to me as a North Korean citizen,

340
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,191
when they dare to trample
on the honor of North Korea.

341
00:23:55,084 --> 00:23:58,501
<i>At the same time,
Malaysia got back nine of its citizens,</i>

342
00:23:58,526 --> 00:24:01,698
<i>who had been stuck in North Korea
during this diplomatic standoff.</i>

343
00:24:03,204 --> 00:24:05,601
<i>The Malaysians insist
that the three North Koreans</i>

344
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:07,879
<i>were not traded
for nine hostages.</i>

345
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:11,641
We are finished with them,
so that's why we allowed them to go.

346
00:24:12,098 --> 00:24:17,165
Malaysia is one of those weird countries who
actually has diplomatic relations with North Korea.

347
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,572
A good working relationship
with North Korea.

348
00:24:20,957 --> 00:24:23,302
<i>It is very, very suspicious.</i>

349
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:27,435
<i>Why did you allow such important
witnesses to go back to North Korea?</i>

350
00:24:28,855 --> 00:24:34,109
If you decide to save the nine Malaysian hostages
in exchange for all those that they demanded,

351
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:37,760
I feel that they don't have the right
to charge the two girls,

352
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:40,832
because you have compromised
their right of defense.

353
00:24:45,983 --> 00:24:47,399
<i>The trial begins today</i>

354
00:24:47,424 --> 00:24:50,068
<i>for the two women accused
of murdering Kim Jong-nam,</i>

355
00:24:50,146 --> 00:24:52,576
<i>the half-brother
of the North Korean premier.</i>

356
00:24:53,312 --> 00:24:55,132
<i>The women claim
hey are innocent.</i>

357
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,033
<i>If found guilty, they face
Malaysia's mandatory death penalty.</i>

358
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:11,821
<i>PROSECUTOR: Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong</i>

359
00:25:11,846 --> 00:25:15,022
<i>PROSECUTOR: are each charged with murder</i>

360
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,341
<i>PROSECUTOR: along with four others at large</i>

361
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:21,061
<i>PROSECUTOR: against a man named Kim Chol.</i>

362
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:28,599
<i>Inside the courtroom, the prosecution is
referring to Kim Jong-nam as "Kim Chol,"</i>

363
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,480
<i>which is the take name that
appears on his passport.</i>

364
00:25:32,646 --> 00:25:37,059
<i>And what was interesting
and perhaps controversial,</i>

365
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:41,449
<i>is that the prosecution also charged
four North Koreans who are still at large,</i>

366
00:25:41,703 --> 00:25:46,373
<i>but was very reluctant to
name the four North Koreans.</i>

367
00:25:47,992 --> 00:25:52,351
<i>HISYAM: I think we ought to know before
the trial starts who the four persons are.</i>

368
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,661
<i>HISYAM: The prosecution has
got a legal duty to disclose,</i>

369
00:25:55,886 --> 00:25:58,670
<i>HISYAM: at the same time
a moral duty to disclose.</i>

370
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,485
<i>JUDGE: I find the
omission to state the name</i>

371
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,237
<i>JUDGE: of the four persons at large</i>

372
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,586
<i>JUDGE: does not make the charge ambiguous.</i>

373
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:09,182
<i>JUDGE: Objection is hereby overruled.</i>

374
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:15,027
It was not a good start
for us.

375
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:23,091
<i>No matter what the position
that the prosecution is taking,</i>

376
00:26:24,742 --> 00:26:28,148
<i>you cannot ignore the political
angle of the assassination.</i>

377
00:26:37,313 --> 00:26:40,233
<i>Kim Jong-il died in 2011.</i>

378
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:44,744
<i>And Kim Jong-un was officially
unveiled as the successor</i>

379
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,626
<i>when he was 25 years old.</i>

380
00:26:49,781 --> 00:26:53,981
<i>There was a great deal of skepticism
when Kim Jong-un was announced.</i>

381
00:26:55,496 --> 00:26:56,912
<i>He had no experience.</i>

382
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,596
<i>He was barely out of college
at that stage.</i>

383
00:26:59,896 --> 00:27:01,362
<i>And there was the question</i>

384
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:05,603
<i>if the old guard in North
Korea, if they would tolerate</i>

385
00:27:05,628 --> 00:27:09,171
<i>this young upstart coming in
and ordering them around.</i>

386
00:27:11,414 --> 00:27:15,582
So there was a lot of doubt in
Seoul, in Tokyo, in Washington,

387
00:27:15,607 --> 00:27:17,205
that Kim Jong-un would be able

388
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,883
to keep this totalitarian
regime together.

389
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:24,549
<i>So, since Kim Jong-un came
into power,</i>

390
00:27:24,574 --> 00:27:27,501
<i>he has very kind of
strategically acted</i>

391
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:30,746
<i>to instill loyalty
at the top of the regime,</i>

392
00:27:30,994 --> 00:27:33,501
<i>to make sure that the people
who support him,</i>

393
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,494
<i>the elites who keep him
in power,</i>

394
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,319
<i>have even more reason
than ever to keep him there.</i>

395
00:27:39,414 --> 00:27:43,154
<i>So, the millennials of Pyongyang
can now do yoga classes</i>

396
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:44,592
<i>and drink cappuccinos</i>

397
00:27:44,617 --> 00:27:46,693
<i>and they live a much better life</i>

398
00:27:46,718 --> 00:27:49,329
<i>than under his father
or his grandfather.</i>

399
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:52,093
But the other part is fear.

400
00:27:52,688 --> 00:27:54,801
<i>He also needs to keep them
terrified.</i>

401
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:59,360
<i>And the way that he has done
this is by getting rid of anybody</i>

402
00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:01,705
<i>who threatens him,
who questions him,</i>

403
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,252
<i>who may in some way suggest</i>

404
00:28:03,277 --> 00:28:05,945
<i>that he's not the legitimate
leader of North Korea.</i>

405
00:28:06,442 --> 00:28:10,215
<i>And as part of that, a lot of
senior figures in the regime</i>

406
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,621
<i>have been purged.</i>

407
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:15,816
<i>Even his uncle,
Jang Song-thaek, was executed.</i>

408
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:22,639
<i>And this is very much Kim
Jong-un's MO for staying in power.</i>

409
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:24,805
<i>No one is safe.</i>

410
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,277
<i>And it was around that time,
you know, Kim Jong-nam</i>

411
00:28:29,302 --> 00:28:31,558
<i>was traveling a lot around
southeast Asia,</i>

412
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:34,884
<i>and he made, you know,
several surprising remarks,</i>

413
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:38,988
<i>where he seemed to question his
brother's legitimacy to lead</i>

414
00:28:39,228 --> 00:28:43,542
<i>and whether North Korea should
have hereditary succession.</i>

415
00:28:46,752 --> 00:28:48,867
Hello, are you Mr. Kim Jong-nam?

416
00:28:48,892 --> 00:28:51,025
Yes, I am. Hello.

417
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:55,010
As the first son,
are you fine not being the successor?

418
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,800
Personally I'm against a third-generation
succession of the dynasty.

419
00:29:01,425 --> 00:29:03,104
<i>And because of that,</i>

420
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:08,008
<i>because he was, you know, threatening
Kim Jong-un's right to lead North Korea,</i>

421
00:29:08,255 --> 00:29:11,701
<i>Kim Jong-nam was somebody who
certainly would be considered a threat</i>

422
00:29:11,726 --> 00:29:14,788
<i>by Kim Jong-un and whose life
could be in danger.</i>

423
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:29,380
<i>Today the prosecution is calling Dr. Raja,</i>

424
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:32,367
<i>who is the government's
chemical weapons expert.</i>

425
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,087
<i>DR. RAJA: My lord, VX is the deadliest
nerve agent ever created by a human being.</i>

426
00:29:40,433 --> 00:29:43,779
<i>DR. RAJA: A drop of VX is
sufficient to cause fatality.</i>

427
00:29:44,774 --> 00:29:48,013
<i>DR. RAJA: We identified
VX on blazer of victim</i>

428
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:51,227
<i>DR. RAJA: and face and
eye mucosa of victim.</i>

429
00:29:51,697 --> 00:29:54,603
<i>DR. RAJA: We found
degradation product of VX</i>

430
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:57,523
<i>DR. RAJA: on sleeveless
shirt of Siti Aisyah.</i>

431
00:29:57,693 --> 00:30:02,363
<i>DR. RAJA: We found VX
on LOL t-shirt of Doan.</i>

432
00:30:03,406 --> 00:30:10,619
<i>PROSECUTOR: What if just one drop of
VX came into contact to human skin?</i>

433
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,963
<i>DR. RAJA: If you decontaminate
within fifteen minutes,</i>

434
00:30:14,109 --> 00:30:18,169
<i>DR. RAJA: you most likely will not
see any effect or some delayed effect.</i>

435
00:30:21,434 --> 00:30:25,250
<i>So the big takeaway from his
testimony is that it answers</i>

436
00:30:25,628 --> 00:30:30,360
<i>this lingering question of why the VX
chemical, which we know is very toxic,</i>

437
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:36,063
can kill Kim Jong-nam but it did
not kill Siti Aisyah and Doan.

438
00:30:36,397 --> 00:30:39,897
He explained that because the palm,
number one, is thick,

439
00:30:40,032 --> 00:30:41,303
the skin is thick.

440
00:30:41,557 --> 00:30:43,475
Number two, it has a lot of fats.

441
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:46,637
So it was very difficult for the VX liquid

442
00:30:46,662 --> 00:30:50,039
to penetrate through the
skin into the bloodstream.

443
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:53,559
Unlike when VX is applied onto the eyes.

444
00:30:54,349 --> 00:30:57,283
<i>The Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons,</i>

445
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:01,830
<i>which represents 192 nations,
issued a statement saying,</i>

446
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,245
<i>"Any use of chemical weapons
is deeply disturbing."</i>

447
00:31:06,275 --> 00:31:09,751
<i>While North Korea has not
acknowledged it has chemical weapons,</i>

448
00:31:09,776 --> 00:31:13,163
<i>South Korea estimates the
regime has a stockpile</i>

449
00:31:13,188 --> 00:31:15,989
<i>of up to 5,000 metric tons.</i>

450
00:31:17,697 --> 00:31:21,917
<i>Now, if somebody brings a
chemical weapon into your country,</i>

451
00:31:22,978 --> 00:31:25,672
<i>to me that tantamounts
to a declaration of war.</i>

452
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:28,052
And VX,

453
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,831
who can have possession of VX?

454
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:33,397
No ordinary people.

455
00:31:33,876 --> 00:31:37,936
<i>GOOI: I refer to the things that were</i>

456
00:31:38,454 --> 00:31:41,914
<i>GOOI: seized or obtained from the
North Korean scientist by the name of</i>

457
00:31:42,372 --> 00:31:44,094
<i>GOOI: Ri Jong Chol.</i>

458
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:46,403
<i>GOOI: Were you taken to his house?</i>

459
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,989
<i>DR. RAJA: No, my lord.</i>

460
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:53,621
<i>GOOI: You therefore have
no knowledge whether</i>

461
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:56,878
<i>GOOI: his house was in
fact a clandestine lab?</i>

462
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,158
<i>DR. RAJA: No, my lord.</i>

463
00:32:04,717 --> 00:32:08,386
<i>The investigation is very
shallow, I would say.</i>

464
00:32:11,302 --> 00:32:13,206
<i>Ri Jong Choi is a chemist.</i>

465
00:32:13,207 --> 00:32:17,544
<i>The police did not even investigate
whether the VX actually came from him.</i>

466
00:32:18,826 --> 00:32:21,161
Both the girls,
they never washed their clothes.

467
00:32:21,186 --> 00:32:22,912
They never disposed of their clothes.

468
00:32:23,132 --> 00:32:26,815
If they knew VX was so poisonous,
if they actually knew it was VX,

469
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:29,841
would they take the chance
of exposing themselves

470
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:31,895
to such a dangerous poison?

471
00:32:39,301 --> 00:32:40,568
Okay.

472
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,365
<i>When Siti was arrested,</i>

473
00:32:47,935 --> 00:32:50,386
<i>we went to visit her in prison.</i>

474
00:32:53,102 --> 00:32:55,995
<i>My first impression of, uh...</i>

475
00:32:57,314 --> 00:32:59,730
her whole demeanor,
whole conduct.

476
00:33:00,055 --> 00:33:02,367
She doesn't know anything.

477
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:07,302
<i>That is when we found out
Siti's story.</i>

478
00:33:15,942 --> 00:33:17,484
<i>SITI:
When I was arrested,</i>

479
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:21,415
<i>SITI:
I was with my roommate in my room.</i>

480
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,214
<i>SITI:
My room was not locked. It never was.</i>

481
00:33:26,866 --> 00:33:30,234
<i>SITI:
Then the police pushed the door open.</i>

482
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:36,537
<i>SITI: The police asked,
"Where were you on the 13th?"</i>

483
00:33:39,835 --> 00:33:42,003
<i>SITI:
"At the airport," I said.</i>

484
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:44,848
<i>SITI:
"With whom?"</i>

485
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:47,884
<i>SITI:
"With Mr. Chang, my boss," I said.</i>

486
00:33:48,565 --> 00:33:50,316
<i>SITI:
"Can you call him?"</i>

487
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:56,925
<i>SITI: So I called Mr. Chang,
but the number wasn't active.</i>

488
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:02,731
<i>SITI: The police asked, "Who are you?
Are you a spy?"</i>

489
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:09,823
<i>SITI:
"What did you do that caused
that man in the airport to die?"</i>

490
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:16,220
<i>SITI: I was confused.
I didn't understand what they meant.</i>

491
00:34:16,546 --> 00:34:21,800
<i>SITI:
"You are involved in the premeditated
murder of the Korean president's brother."</i>

492
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:27,139
<i>SITI:
I was shocked. "You're kidding."</i>

493
00:34:27,854 --> 00:34:30,805
<i>SITI:
"I was doing a video shoot."</i>

494
00:34:32,944 --> 00:34:37,277
<i>SITI:
"Is this part of the video prank?"</i>

495
00:34:40,672 --> 00:34:42,021
<i>Siti,</i>

496
00:34:42,022 --> 00:34:45,452
<i>she in fact thought that she was
part of a prank show.</i>

497
00:34:46,481 --> 00:34:48,743
<i>And we had to persuade her,</i>

498
00:34:48,768 --> 00:34:50,368
<i>to tell her, "Look,</i>

499
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:52,515
<i>someone really died.</i>

500
00:34:52,951 --> 00:34:54,725
<i>This is not a prank show.</i>

501
00:34:55,105 --> 00:34:58,518
<i>And now you are being charged for murder."</i>

502
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:04,304
<i>As criminal lawyers,
we have our reservations.</i>

503
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:07,483
We have to be very objective.

504
00:35:07,568 --> 00:35:10,196
Okay, not to believe 100%.

505
00:35:11,154 --> 00:35:13,947
<i>The issue is whether they
know what they were doing.</i>

506
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:19,786
<i>And could they have been duped to believe
that they are acting in a prank show?</i>

507
00:35:31,168 --> 00:35:32,928
HISYAM TEH POH TEIK:

508
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:34,976
<i>When Doan grew up,
she went to Hanoi to get her education.</i>

509
00:35:36,543 --> 00:35:40,310
<i>Although she studied accountancy
in a private university,</i>

510
00:35:41,454 --> 00:35:44,289
<i>after that she couldn't
get a job as an accountant.</i>

511
00:35:49,452 --> 00:35:52,899
<i>She ended up working
as a waitress in a pub.</i>

512
00:35:54,127 --> 00:35:58,005
<i>And during this time,
she was doing modeling.</i>

513
00:35:58,747 --> 00:36:01,314
<i>And she even took part in Vietnam Idol.</i>

514
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:05,505
Okay.

515
00:36:06,088 --> 00:36:07,331
Okay.

516
00:36:07,646 --> 00:36:09,772
<i>Her aspiration is to be an actress.</i>

517
00:36:10,277 --> 00:36:11,993
<i>She wants to be famous.</i>

518
00:36:14,027 --> 00:36:15,945
<i>Even in her statement to the police,</i>

519
00:36:16,102 --> 00:36:19,020
<i>she described her occupation as an actress.</i>

520
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,200
<i>Do you need an interpreter to
translate from English to Vietnamese?</i>

521
00:36:32,928 --> 00:36:36,768
<i>DOAN: No, because I can try
speak and understand English.</i>

522
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,174
<i>DOAN:
I work as waitress for three years.</i>

523
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,554
I have a colleague named Thuy.

524
00:36:50,662 --> 00:36:53,769
<i>DOAN:
In early December 2016,</i>

525
00:36:54,204 --> 00:36:56,402
<i>DOAN:
she called my cellphone.</i>

526
00:36:57,736 --> 00:36:58,986
<i>DOAN:
She said,</i>

527
00:36:59,978 --> 00:37:05,331
<i>DOAN:
"Do you want working for company
about short movie or funny video?</i>

528
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:09,531
<i>DOAN:
Come to shop Hay Bar.</i>

529
00:37:09,757 --> 00:37:11,299
<i>DOAN:
We are waiting here."</i>

530
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:15,150
<i>DOAN:
I come alone and</i>

531
00:37:15,175 --> 00:37:19,971
<i>DOAN: I saw Thuy and a guy
sitting near the counter bar.</i>

532
00:37:21,497 --> 00:37:23,964
<i>DOAN:
I asked him, "What's your name?"</i>

533
00:37:24,234 --> 00:37:27,064
<i>DOAN:
And he answered me in Vietnamese language.</i>

534
00:37:28,147 --> 00:37:29,897
<i>DOAN:
"Call me Mr. Y."</i>

535
00:37:32,082 --> 00:37:34,822
<i>DOAN:
He explained about the funny video.</i>

536
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:41,227
<i>DOAN:
He asked me how much I want for a month.</i>

537
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:47,714
<i>DOAN: I feel shy but I say,
"I want US dollar 1000."</i>

538
00:37:49,418 --> 00:37:54,544
<i>DOAN: He tell me his boss
can pay for the funny video.</i>

539
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:02,127
<i>So now we are finding out
that both women are claiming</i>

540
00:38:02,243 --> 00:38:04,747
that they have been going
around Asia for months

541
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:07,435
doing prank shows for
what they believe to be

542
00:38:07,436 --> 00:38:09,495
a Japanese production company.

543
00:38:10,631 --> 00:38:12,644
<i>And their last prank</i>

544
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:16,771
<i>would be the murder
assassination of Kim Jong-nam.</i>

545
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:44,584
There's this culture of
doing amateur prank videos.

546
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:48,439
<i>I think it came from people
watching shows like "Jackass." '</i>

547
00:38:55,490 --> 00:39:00,024
And with the access allowed by social media
nowadays, people want to do that themselves.

548
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:09,121
<i>So it's not really out of the ordinary for
people to do prank videos here in Asia.</i>

549
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:14,467
And Doan was doing this
series of prank shows.

550
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:27,098
<i>In 2016, Doan took part in two pranks</i>

551
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:29,017
<i>which were uploaded onto YouTube.</i>

552
00:39:30,853 --> 00:39:32,395
<i>This is Doan now.</i>

553
00:39:33,696 --> 00:39:35,487
<i>I want to emphasize that this prank</i>

554
00:39:35,512 --> 00:39:38,662
<i>is not connected whatsoever
to the North Koreans.</i>

555
00:39:40,304 --> 00:39:43,285
<i>And this is one year before the
incident with Kim Jong-nam.</i>

556
00:39:46,973 --> 00:39:48,560
I slap you, yeah?

557
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:55,251
<i>Is it funny?</i>

558
00:39:56,259 --> 00:39:57,512
It's not uhh...

559
00:40:01,174 --> 00:40:02,287
Yes, it is.

560
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:06,312
<i>But whether it's funny does not matter.</i>

561
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,704
This is part of the evidence

562
00:40:09,961 --> 00:40:13,424
to show that in fact she was
acting in funny video clips

563
00:40:13,943 --> 00:40:16,982
a long time before she
met the North Koreans.

564
00:40:29,879 --> 00:40:31,213
Siti is here.

565
00:40:32,915 --> 00:40:34,582
The one wearing sunglasses.

566
00:40:36,858 --> 00:40:41,565
<i>I really want her to come home.</i>

567
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:47,869
<i>Siti went to school until 6th grade.</i>

568
00:40:50,529 --> 00:40:58,272
<i>And then, in time, she needed to find work.</i>

569
00:41:05,238 --> 00:41:06,984
<i>SITI:
When I was young,</i>

570
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:10,158
<i>SITI:
I saw my family was poor.</i>

571
00:41:11,828 --> 00:41:14,294
<i>SITI:
I wanted to help my family.</i>

572
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,721
<i>SITI:
So I went to Jakarta.</i>

573
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,683
<i>SITI:
I found work at a clothing factory.</i>

574
00:41:35,798 --> 00:41:40,469
<i>SITI: And that is when I
got married to the owner.</i>

575
00:41:43,429 --> 00:41:47,076
<i>SITI:
And then, I had my son when I was 17.</i>

576
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:50,805
<i>SITI:
I liked being a mother,</i>

577
00:41:51,788 --> 00:41:54,918
<i>SITI:
but I was young and had to work a lot.</i>

578
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:57,991
<i>SITI:
At the clothing factory,</i>

579
00:41:58,203 --> 00:42:02,471
<i>SITI:
people saw me as being that
little girl from the village.</i>

580
00:42:04,325 --> 00:42:11,758
<i>SITI: I would work from
7:30 or 8 AM until midnight.</i>

581
00:42:18,812 --> 00:42:23,425
<i>SITI:
I didn't have any other work
experience so I had no other choice.</i>

582
00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:30,995
<i>SITI:
Then in 2012,</i>

583
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,142
<i>SITI:
my husband and I got a divorce.</i>

584
00:42:36,064 --> 00:42:41,564
<i>SITI: And my son went to live
with my ex-husband's father.</i>

585
00:42:45,161 --> 00:42:46,788
<i>SITI:
Of course I was sad.</i>

586
00:42:47,325 --> 00:42:52,454
<i>SITI: But my life was just to
work and find money to eat.</i>

587
00:42:56,605 --> 00:42:58,385
<i>I think for Siti...</i>

588
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,632
<i>life was difficult.
She had to survive.</i>

589
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:06,148
<i>And so in the hope
of a better life,</i>

590
00:43:06,301 --> 00:43:08,121
<i>for her and her family,</i>

591
00:43:08,192 --> 00:43:11,335
she came to Kuala Lumpur
to look for a better job.

592
00:43:16,776 --> 00:43:19,203
<i>SITI:
Kuala Lumpur, in my opinion,</i>

593
00:43:19,946 --> 00:43:22,447
<i>SITI:
is progressive compared to Jakarta.</i>

594
00:43:23,566 --> 00:43:28,960
<i>SITI:
In Kuala Lumpur I could go out around town.</i>

595
00:43:30,895 --> 00:43:35,829
<i>SITI: I saw lots of
fashionable people at the mall.</i>

596
00:43:38,363 --> 00:43:40,322
<i>SITI:
From there I learned,</i>

597
00:43:40,872 --> 00:43:44,750
<i>SITI:
oh, I can change and be pretty.</i>

598
00:43:47,252 --> 00:43:50,125
<i>SITI:
In the beginning, I was happy.</i>

599
00:43:59,134 --> 00:44:01,327
For a young migrant,

600
00:44:02,183 --> 00:44:03,534
women especially,

601
00:44:04,046 --> 00:44:05,441
coming to Malaysia,

602
00:44:06,604 --> 00:44:08,904
<i>it can be a very dangerous world.</i>

603
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:14,626
<i>Most often they come here</i>

604
00:44:15,283 --> 00:44:17,795
<i>believing in a promise of a secure job,</i>

605
00:44:18,377 --> 00:44:20,169
<i>but when they arrive,</i>

606
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:24,137
<i>they find themselves in a
very different environment,</i>

607
00:44:25,689 --> 00:44:27,695
<i>the underbelly of Kuala Lumpur.</i>

608
00:44:29,092 --> 00:44:32,739
<i>And some of them being
forced into prostitution,</i>

609
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:34,652
<i>sexual slavery.</i>

610
00:44:36,588 --> 00:44:39,274
<i>And they usually don't
have any say about it.</i>

611
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:58,569
<i>When I first met Siti,</i>

612
00:45:00,888 --> 00:45:03,861
<i>she was a village girl,</i>

613
00:45:03,886 --> 00:45:05,929
<i>still a teenager.</i>

614
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:12,106
<i>She had a job working at a spa.</i>

615
00:45:13,236 --> 00:45:20,451
I knew that she did not like
her job as a sex worker.

616
00:45:23,926 --> 00:45:26,939
<i>But she had no other choice.</i>

617
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:31,059
<i>This was the only kind of
work to earn good money.</i>

618
00:45:34,929 --> 00:45:38,116
<i>According to Siti,
there was this person</i>

619
00:45:38,513 --> 00:45:41,222
<i>John, this taxi driver,</i>

620
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:44,133
<i>who introduced her
to the North Koreans.</i>

621
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:51,355
There were, what-- two, three
attempts for us to meet John.

622
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:56,051
<i>But the police,
they could not produce him.</i>

623
00:45:56,506 --> 00:45:58,473
<i>They said he was uncontactable.</i>

624
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:16,044
<i>I will start from the beginning, okay?</i>

625
00:46:16,503 --> 00:46:20,173
<i>One night, this guy approached me
in front of the mall entrance.</i>

626
00:46:21,554 --> 00:46:24,394
<i>He said he wanted to go to
Kuala Lumpur City Centre.</i>

627
00:46:29,764 --> 00:46:31,244
<i>He said his name was James,</i>

628
00:46:31,439 --> 00:46:33,251
<i>and he was from Japan.</i>

629
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,826
<i>He was looking for girls
to act in a prank video.</i>

630
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:45,084
<i>He told me, "If you find any
girls, then give me a call."</i>

631
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:52,722
<i>Around 3 o'clock in the
morning, the club closes.</i>

632
00:46:52,999 --> 00:46:56,396
<i>The girls there will come outside
and look for customers.</i>

633
00:46:58,354 --> 00:47:02,816
<i>That night, I saw Siti there by herself.</i>

634
00:47:04,816 --> 00:47:08,849
<i>SITI: John asked,
"Do you want to do a video shoot?</i>

635
00:47:10,023 --> 00:47:12,608
<i>SITI:
A guy from Japan</i>

636
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:17,249
<i>SITI: is looking for an
actress for a video shoot."</i>

637
00:47:19,531 --> 00:47:23,220
<i>I had asked many girls there
if they'd be interested,</i>

638
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:27,048
but Siti was the only person who agreed.

639
00:47:53,933 --> 00:47:55,900
The entire text messages, we went through.

640
00:47:56,594 --> 00:47:57,860
Hundreds of pages.

641
00:47:58,353 --> 00:47:59,640
<i>Thousands.</i>

642
00:47:59,692 --> 00:48:01,235
Thousands of pages.

643
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,364
Nothing to indicate that

644
00:48:04,794 --> 00:48:08,755
she had anything sinister or that she
was involved in the assassination.

645
00:48:26,262 --> 00:48:31,115
<i>SITI:
After getting to Pavilion,</i>

646
00:48:31,693 --> 00:48:37,171
<i>SITI: John introduced me to
the boss from Japan, James.</i>

647
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:44,437
<i>SITI:
James put baby lotion on my hands.</i>

648
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:48,756
<i>SITI:
I was instructed to hold someone's hand,</i>

649
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:52,189
<i>SITI:
look at their face, then say sorry.</i>

650
00:48:54,937 --> 00:48:58,518
<i>SITI: I didn't think the
prank videos were that funny.</i>

651
00:48:59,017 --> 00:49:01,898
<i>SITI: But he convinced me
that every Japanese prank show</i>

652
00:49:01,923 --> 00:49:05,076
<i>SITI:
has its own style.</i>

653
00:49:07,622 --> 00:49:11,088
<i>SITI:
Then he paid me 400 ringgits (96 USD),</i>

654
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,819
<i>SITI:
I thought, "That's easy money
for doing such a simple thing."</i>

655
00:49:17,611 --> 00:49:21,489
<i>SITI:
And I could send it home to my parents.</i>

656
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:25,497
1-6-8, there.

657
00:49:25,781 --> 00:49:28,017
This is a photo of James.

658
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:33,493
This is John, the taxi driver
who introduced her to James.

659
00:49:33,644 --> 00:49:37,080
And this is Siti, at the very
first meeting at Pavilion.

660
00:49:37,337 --> 00:49:38,622
This photo--

661
00:49:38,647 --> 00:49:41,548
Someone who knew John
saw him there

662
00:49:41,758 --> 00:49:44,934
and took a photograph
and posted it in a group chat.

663
00:49:45,636 --> 00:49:49,688
It is coincidental.
Thank God for this photo.

664
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:54,928
The photograph essentially
confirms Siti'’s story.

665
00:50:00,978 --> 00:50:05,903
<i>Today the prosecution is putting the
investigating officer to the witness stand,</i>

666
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,712
<i>Wan Azirul.</i>

667
00:50:07,837 --> 00:50:11,465
<i>He is the prosecution's
star witness in this case.</i>

668
00:50:12,338 --> 00:50:20,292
<i>PROSECUTOR: You mentioned earlier about the role of
the four North Koreans. Can you tell us their role?</i>

669
00:50:20,672 --> 00:50:28,011
<i>WAN AZIRUL: The four suspects were the people who provided
both Siti and Doan with ongoing training exercises</i>

670
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:34,259
<i>WAN AZIRUL: to ensure that their actions on
the day of the incident would be successful.</i>

671
00:50:34,452 --> 00:50:36,052
<i>HISYAM: Objection, my lord.</i>

672
00:50:36,476 --> 00:50:38,819
<i>The investigating officer
used the word "training."</i>

673
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:41,222
- Yes. That's right.
- We objected.

674
00:50:41,606 --> 00:50:45,009
This is pure interpretation
by the investigating officer.

675
00:50:45,499 --> 00:50:50,698
His version is Doan and Siti Aisyah
were taking part in training.

676
00:50:51,942 --> 00:50:54,068
And we have in fact strong evidence

677
00:50:55,012 --> 00:50:57,102
to show that she is in fact

678
00:50:57,258 --> 00:51:00,802
being tricked,
being duped to do what she did.

679
00:51:08,909 --> 00:51:12,787
<i>DOAN:
Mr. Y said meet at big theater Hanoi.</i>

680
00:51:14,015 --> 00:51:18,208
<i>DOAN:
He told me how to do action in the video.</i>

681
00:51:19,683 --> 00:51:24,110
<i>DOAN:
He said go talk and give surprise kiss</i>

682
00:51:24,197 --> 00:51:27,293
<i>DOAN:
on the cheek to anybody he choose.</i>

683
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:33,414
<i>DOAN: After that,
a Korean man - really old - came to us and</i>

684
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:36,919
<i>DOAN:
we went to coffee shop nearby and sitting.</i>

685
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:41,617
<i>DOAN:
Mr. Y said, "This is my boss."</i>

686
00:51:41,896 --> 00:51:44,077
<i>DOAN:
I asked the bass his name.</i>

687
00:51:45,148 --> 00:51:48,693
<i>DOAN:
Mr. Y told me, "Hanamori means uncle."</i>

688
00:51:49,757 --> 00:51:52,257
<i>DOAN:
"So, just sail him Hanamori."</i>

689
00:51:59,762 --> 00:52:03,458
<i>Siti, there was a prank
on the 9th of January.</i>

690
00:52:03,883 --> 00:52:05,678
<i>At Mandarin Oriental.</i>

691
00:52:06,279 --> 00:52:08,932
<i>And she made a video of James.</i>

692
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,777
<i>James could not speak proper English.</i>

693
00:52:14,192 --> 00:52:15,750
Listen, listen.

694
00:52:16,252 --> 00:52:17,579
Turn off the camera.

695
00:52:18,103 --> 00:52:19,203
Turn off!

696
00:52:19,378 --> 00:52:21,055
And they were communicating

697
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,038
using Google Translate.

698
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:26,378
<i>So to ensure that the
whole thing will go well,</i>

699
00:52:26,403 --> 00:52:28,811
<i>they introduce Mr. Chang.</i>

700
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:34,250
<i>SITI: Mr. Chang was very
good at speaking Indonesian.</i>

701
00:52:35,492 --> 00:52:36,903
<i>SITI:
He was different from James.</i>

702
00:52:36,928 --> 00:52:40,764
<i>SITI:
Chang was a little... flirtatious.</i>

703
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:44,933
<i>The prank jobs that they
were doing at that time,</i>

704
00:52:45,173 --> 00:52:47,480
<i>we call them "mistaken identity."</i>

705
00:52:48,871 --> 00:52:51,350
They come from behind,
close somebody's eyes.

706
00:52:51,636 --> 00:52:54,096
Like, "Guess who I am?" sort of thing.

707
00:52:55,198 --> 00:52:57,866
<i>She was paid a few hundred US dollars.</i>

708
00:52:58,176 --> 00:53:01,931
<i>And I think that was a fairly
good remuneration for her.</i>

709
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:04,156
Why you filming me?

710
00:53:09,212 --> 00:53:10,485
<i>SITI:
They told me,</i>

711
00:53:10,755 --> 00:53:15,759
<i>SITI:
"You'll go to Singapore,
to America... everywhere.</i>

712
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:24,067
<i>SITI: You'll become famous
as the video prank actress."</i>

713
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,100
<i>Doan did a prank at the Vietnamese airport.</i>

714
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:32,475
And, in fact, we have the DVD.

715
00:53:33,403 --> 00:53:35,821
<i>That is Doan here in white.</i>

716
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:41,449
<i>DOAN:
Mr. Y gave my hand Johnson baby cream.</i>

717
00:53:43,857 --> 00:53:47,725
<i>DOAN:
He said I make surprise same like before.</i>

718
00:53:49,446 --> 00:53:51,366
Okay, watch this gentleman closely.

719
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:57,239
<i>And on the other side,</i>

720
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:58,844
<i>there you see?</i>

721
00:53:58,845 --> 00:54:00,199
<i>Doan running,</i>

722
00:54:02,723 --> 00:54:04,763
<i>coming behind the gentleman.</i>

723
00:54:08,062 --> 00:54:10,645
<i>Yep.
She did the prank.</i>

724
00:54:11,688 --> 00:54:13,314
<i>And you see a gentleman here</i>

725
00:54:13,596 --> 00:54:15,555
<i>videoing the prank.</i>

726
00:54:15,845 --> 00:54:17,304
<i>There you are: Mr. Y.</i>

727
00:54:52,107 --> 00:54:55,221
<i>A few days later,
Doan took a flight.</i>

728
00:54:57,156 --> 00:54:59,182
<i>She came to Kuala Lumpur
together with Mr. Y,</i>

729
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,656
<i>and one more prank at the KLIA airport.</i>

730
00:55:29,551 --> 00:55:31,824
<i>Siti had three days of pranks,</i>

731
00:55:32,237 --> 00:55:36,037
<i>all at the arrival of the Kuala
Lumpur International Airport.</i>

732
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:39,702
<i>And then she posted
a video of KLIA.</i>

733
00:55:41,444 --> 00:55:44,127
<i>You know, if I was going
to assassinate someone,</i>

734
00:55:44,152 --> 00:55:46,917
<i>surely I would not tell them
where I got trained.</i>

735
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:53,372
<i>As young women, they had documented
so much of this on social media.</i>

736
00:55:53,758 --> 00:55:56,210
I mean, one of the great things
about technology here

737
00:55:56,235 --> 00:55:58,237
is that it did create this trail

738
00:55:58,262 --> 00:56:01,178
<i>which showed the relationships
between the women</i>

739
00:56:01,203 --> 00:56:03,422
<i>and their North Korean handlers</i>

740
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:06,323
<i>that could enable them
to put up a defense.</i>

741
00:56:10,752 --> 00:56:15,424
<i>PROSECUTOR: Based on your investigation,
do you agree that this was a prank?</i>

742
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:19,453
<i>WAN AZIRUL: To me, the "prank" that was
acted out by both of them</i>

743
00:56:19,478 --> 00:56:24,820
<i>WAN AZIRUL: is something that doesn't
make any sense and is illogical.</i>

744
00:56:25,734 --> 00:56:29,277
"The specific act was more of an attack
that was specifically targeted

745
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:32,814
and perpetrated by both defendants
on the day of the incident."

746
00:56:35,835 --> 00:56:37,669
<i>As the investigating officer,</i>

747
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:41,298
<i>you are supposed to investigate
based on the evidence,</i>

748
00:56:41,299 --> 00:56:44,450
you are not supposed to
come out with judgement.

749
00:56:45,546 --> 00:56:49,424
<i>It shows he already made up his mind
early on that these girls are guilty,</i>

750
00:56:50,224 --> 00:56:54,269
<i>and he and the prosecution are basically</i>

751
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:56,130
<i>reading from the same book.</i>

752
00:56:58,103 --> 00:57:00,863
Look at the evidence
completely and entirely.

753
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:04,585
These girls have got no motive whatsoever.

754
00:57:05,406 --> 00:57:07,392
<i>But look at the North Koreans.</i>

755
00:57:08,086 --> 00:57:09,992
<i>North Korea has got an interest.</i>

756
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:20,165
<i>Kim Jong-nam had been living
in Macau for more than a decade.</i>

757
00:57:20,817 --> 00:57:23,052
<i>And there are a number of rumors</i>

758
00:57:23,077 --> 00:57:25,510
<i>that this was not
the first attempt on his life,</i>

759
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:30,776
<i>that Kim Jong-un had tried repeatedly
to assassinate Kim Jong-nam.</i>

760
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:33,922
<i>In fact, the South Korean
intelligence reported</i>

761
00:57:33,947 --> 00:57:38,755
<i>that Kim Jong-nam had actually written a
letter to his brother, saying, you know,</i>

762
00:57:38,915 --> 00:57:40,454
"Please stop trying to kill me,"

763
00:57:40,479 --> 00:57:42,722
like, "I am not a threat
to you."

764
00:57:43,275 --> 00:57:45,582
<i>You know, "I do not want
to be the leader.</i>

765
00:57:47,193 --> 00:57:49,620
<i>"Please let me and my family...</i>

766
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,680
<i>please let us live our lives."</i>

767
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:59,351
<i>So he was extremely careful and
conscious that he was always in danger.</i>

768
00:58:01,206 --> 00:58:03,859
<i>But because he was living
in China,</i>

769
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:07,364
<i>for North Korea to assassinate
Kim Jong-nam,</i>

770
00:58:07,419 --> 00:58:11,827
<i>it's very difficult because, you
know, North Korea is reliant on China.</i>

771
00:58:12,887 --> 00:58:17,940
<i>They are North Korea's number-one
benefactor, patron state.</i>

772
00:58:18,419 --> 00:58:20,439
<i>And from China's point of view,</i>

773
00:58:20,481 --> 00:58:24,865
<i>they had given Kim Jong-nam
kind of exile protection,</i>

774
00:58:25,232 --> 00:58:27,902
<i>and in some ways were maybe
keeping him in reserve,</i>

775
00:58:28,153 --> 00:58:30,811
<i>that if they wanted to replace
Kim Jong-un,</i>

776
00:58:30,899 --> 00:58:34,978
<i>they could install Kim Jong-nam
as the leader of North Korea.</i>

777
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,927
So there's no way
that North Korea could ever

778
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,556
conduct such an audacious
assassination,

779
00:58:42,747 --> 00:58:45,906
or any assassination,
on Chinese soil.

780
00:58:46,077 --> 00:58:49,148
So they had to make sure
they caught Kim Jong-nam

781
00:58:49,173 --> 00:58:50,994
<i>when he was outside of China.</i>

782
00:59:02,811 --> 00:59:05,563
<i>On February 8th, 2017,</i>

783
00:59:06,717 --> 00:59:09,017
just like days before he was -

784
00:59:09,351 --> 00:59:10,617
before he was killed,

785
00:59:11,323 --> 00:59:14,284
<i>Kim Jong-nam flew to Langkawi,</i>

786
00:59:14,285 --> 00:59:18,288
<i>which is a resort island in
the north part of Malaysia.</i>

787
00:59:18,992 --> 00:59:22,173
He checked in at the Westin Hotel.

788
00:59:24,238 --> 00:59:27,418
So, here we have Kim Jong-nam

789
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:31,479
in the elevator
at the Westin Hotel in Langkawi,

790
00:59:31,504 --> 00:59:35,964
with this man, who was later
reported to be a CIA agent.

791
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:39,949
It's never been confirmed
that this man was, in fact,

792
00:59:39,974 --> 00:59:41,458
working for the CIA.

793
00:59:42,493 --> 00:59:46,611
<i>But during the course of my reporting,
I discovered that Kim Jong-nam</i>

794
00:59:46,636 --> 00:59:51,464
<i>had become a CIA informant
after his brother took power.</i>

795
00:59:53,407 --> 00:59:55,408
<i>So he met with this CIA agent,</i>

796
00:59:55,549 --> 00:59:57,607
<i>and they spent two hours together.</i>

797
00:59:59,016 --> 01:00:01,782
<i>And he flew back to Kuala Lumpur,</i>

798
01:00:02,241 --> 01:00:03,976
<i>where he was killed.</i>

799
01:00:07,222 --> 01:00:08,662
<i>After the murder,</i>

800
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:12,236
<i>Malaysian police went through
Kim Jong-nam's laptop.</i>

801
01:00:13,357 --> 01:00:15,274
<i>And they were able to identity that</i>

802
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:20,017
<i>data was removed from the
laptop into a USB drive</i>

803
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:24,211
<i>on the day where Kim Jong-nam
met with the American agent.</i>

804
01:00:25,386 --> 01:00:28,805
<i>In his bag, they found 138,000 US dollars,</i>

805
01:00:29,652 --> 01:00:32,028
<i>which seems to suggest that the money was</i>

806
01:00:32,053 --> 01:00:35,332
<i>payment for the data that was transferred.</i>

807
01:00:36,978 --> 01:00:41,804
The CIA likes to say that North Korea
is the blackest of all the black holes.

808
01:00:42,258 --> 01:00:47,231
<i>They have so little information about
what's happening inside North Korea.</i>

809
01:00:47,764 --> 01:00:50,461
<i>And Kim Jong-nam,
the one thing that he had</i>

810
01:00:50,486 --> 01:00:52,143
<i>that very few other people had</i>

811
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:56,018
<i>was information about the
inner workings of this regime.</i>

812
01:00:57,905 --> 01:01:01,012
And if North Korea had
discovered that Kim Jong-nam

813
01:01:01,151 --> 01:01:05,061
<i>was providing information to the
American intelligence service,</i>

814
01:01:05,206 --> 01:01:08,081
<i>this alone would be reason
for the North Koreans</i>

815
01:01:08,106 --> 01:01:10,453
<i>to try to eliminate him.</i>

816
01:01:18,498 --> 01:01:22,365
<i>DOAN:
On February 4th, 2017,</i>

817
01:01:23,265 --> 01:01:27,545
<i>DOAN: me and Mr. Y together
go to Kuala Lumpur again.</i>

818
01:01:35,921 --> 01:01:39,549
<i>This video clip shows Doan
checking into the hotel.</i>

819
01:01:44,393 --> 01:01:46,479
<i>She had this teddy bear with her.</i>

820
01:01:47,023 --> 01:01:48,203
Huge one.

821
01:01:48,228 --> 01:01:49,979
About the same size as her.

822
01:01:52,026 --> 01:01:53,846
<i>And Mr. Y instructed her</i>

823
01:01:53,944 --> 01:01:56,639
<i>to practice the prank on the teddy bear.</i>

824
01:03:03,347 --> 01:03:04,889
<i>When we started this case,</i>

825
01:03:05,735 --> 01:03:07,743
<i>some of the CCTV footage</i>

826
01:03:07,768 --> 01:03:10,428
<i>was leaked to a Japanese TV station.</i>

827
01:03:10,675 --> 01:03:12,234
<i>And that went viral.</i>

828
01:03:18,737 --> 01:03:20,350
<i>Whereas, the defense counsel,</i>

829
01:03:21,025 --> 01:03:23,597
<i>we have put in lots of
letters to the police</i>

830
01:03:24,428 --> 01:03:27,314
<i>asking for the CCTV footage,</i>

831
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,948
with no reply whatsoever.

832
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:35,154
<i>Now, we finally received the CCTV footage</i>

833
01:03:36,088 --> 01:03:38,089
<i>some six months after the incident.</i>

834
01:03:41,586 --> 01:03:44,679
<i>This is in KLIA2 airport departure hall.</i>

835
01:03:45,538 --> 01:03:48,231
Mr. O Jong-gil
in the white cap

836
01:03:48,256 --> 01:03:51,171
<i>and Hanamori, the guy in the purple shirt.</i>

837
01:03:52,182 --> 01:03:55,302
<i>Hanamori is the mastermind
of the operation, but</i>

838
01:03:56,146 --> 01:03:59,379
<i>O Jong-gil, he is also closely involved.</i>

839
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:04,278
<i>We like to call him the
Godfather of the operation.</i>

840
01:04:12,833 --> 01:04:17,166
<i>DOAN:
Mr. Y said video on the
13th is very important.</i>

841
01:04:18,495 --> 01:04:23,374
<i>DOAN:
So I wear long sleeve
white shirt with LOL print</i>

842
01:04:24,178 --> 01:04:29,138
<i>DOAN:
and I make hairstyle like wave
and makeup beautifully.</i>

843
01:04:29,812 --> 01:04:34,357
<i>DOAN: Mr. Y said company
rent new actor and actress</i>

844
01:04:34,438 --> 01:04:39,317
<i>DOAN: to make more effective
video and put on YouTube.</i>

845
01:04:44,198 --> 01:04:46,524
<i>Siti Aisyah just arrived and</i>

846
01:04:46,837 --> 01:04:49,297
<i>she is taking a seat across from Mr. Chang.</i>

847
01:04:52,581 --> 01:04:56,167
On the table we can actually see
a smartphone mounted on a selfie stick.

848
01:04:58,226 --> 01:05:01,899
<i>SITI: He said,
"Today there will be hidden cameras,</i>

849
01:05:01,975 --> 01:05:04,153
<i>SITI:
so not just me."</i>

850
01:05:07,738 --> 01:05:09,725
<i>So here you can see Siti</i>

851
01:05:10,925 --> 01:05:12,611
<i>high five Mr. Chang.</i>

852
01:05:15,515 --> 01:05:20,055
<i>Either she is oblivious
about what she's about to do,</i>

853
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:22,715
<i>or she is</i>

854
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:24,503
so well trained

855
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:27,240
that the act of killing someone

856
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:29,677
is just another day for her.

857
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:39,865
<i>DOAN:
Mr. Y said the new actor
is a fat man and no hair.</i>

858
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:45,950
<i>This is Kim Jong-nam.</i>

859
01:05:46,334 --> 01:05:49,123
<i>He is looking at the board
to check out his flight to Macau.</i>

860
01:05:49,856 --> 01:05:51,849
<i>If you look very closely,</i>

861
01:05:52,367 --> 01:05:54,222
this over here is Siti.

862
01:05:58,312 --> 01:06:00,532
<i>She is standing next to this column.</i>

863
01:06:02,573 --> 01:06:04,097
<i>She is not alone over there.</i>

864
01:06:04,122 --> 01:06:07,708
<i>She is actually with Mr. Chang,
who is hiding behind this column.</i>

865
01:06:08,103 --> 01:06:09,353
<i>And over here,</i>

866
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:11,549
<i>waiting at the table is Hanamori,</i>

867
01:06:11,577 --> 01:06:12,916
<i>the mastermind.</i>

868
01:06:15,008 --> 01:06:17,288
<i>You can see that when Kim Jong-nam enters,</i>

869
01:06:18,094 --> 01:06:21,827
<i>Hanamori walked toward
Mr. Chang and Siti Aisyah,</i>

870
01:06:21,972 --> 01:06:24,807
<i>indicating that Kim Jong-nam is coming.</i>

871
01:06:25,674 --> 01:06:29,469
And as Kim Jong-nam is
walking towards the kiosk,

872
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:35,842
you can see that Siti moves
and hid behind this column.

873
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,357
<i>SITI:
Suddenly, Mr. Chang said,</i>

874
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:47,820
<i>SITI:
"That's the one, in the gray jacket."</i>

875
01:06:48,941 --> 01:06:51,281
<i>SITI:
He gave me the baby oil.</i>

876
01:06:55,362 --> 01:06:57,549
<i>And now we can see Mr. Chang.</i>

877
01:06:57,998 --> 01:06:59,529
<i>He walks past Kim Jong-nam</i>

878
01:06:59,734 --> 01:07:01,777
<i>to watch the attack happen.</i>

879
01:07:06,298 --> 01:07:09,351
<i>DOAN:
Mr. Y gave me oil on my hand.</i>

880
01:07:10,378 --> 01:07:12,118
<i>DOAN:
He told me, "Don't look."</i>

881
01:07:13,088 --> 01:07:17,515
<i>DOAN: He said,
"Just look at the actor and actress."</i>

882
01:07:19,162 --> 01:07:21,095
<i>I saw the new actress</i>

883
01:07:21,567 --> 01:07:24,549
<i>put hands on his face
from the back.</i>

884
01:07:28,647 --> 01:07:31,316
<i>DOAN:
I ran and do the same surprise.</i>

885
01:07:32,658 --> 01:07:35,080
<i>DOAN:
I put my hand on his eyes.</i>

886
01:07:36,455 --> 01:07:38,275
<i>DOAN:
I say sorry to him.</i>

887
01:07:38,497 --> 01:07:40,456
<i>DOAN:
I running and go.</i>

888
01:07:43,091 --> 01:07:45,885
Looking from this angle
you can see Kim Jong-nam.

889
01:07:51,975 --> 01:07:53,308
<i>He stumbled back.</i>

890
01:07:54,017 --> 01:07:59,188
It's very possible for him to actually start to
feel the effect of the VX chemical right away.

891
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:12,890
<i>SITI: He reacted like he was scared.
It scared me too.</i>

892
01:08:14,739 --> 01:08:16,879
<i>SITI:
So I ran away.</i>

893
01:08:23,216 --> 01:08:25,551
<i>WAN AZIRUL: In this image we see a woman.</i>

894
01:08:26,415 --> 01:08:29,363
<i>WAN AZIRUL: She walks quickly and is seen</i>

895
01:08:29,756 --> 01:08:33,217
<i>WAN AZIRUL: trying to
avoid touching her bag.</i>

896
01:08:36,542 --> 01:08:43,222
<i>WAN AZIRUL: She holds her hands as though she
doesn't want to touch the two moving rails,</i>

897
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:47,158
<i>WAN AZIRUL: shaking her
hands like it's burning.</i>

898
01:08:50,662 --> 01:08:53,734
This video is important
because you can see Siti

899
01:08:54,385 --> 01:08:56,148
rubbing the palm of her hand.

900
01:08:58,036 --> 01:09:01,515
<i>And Wan Azirul's testimony was that Siti</i>

901
01:09:01,661 --> 01:09:03,870
<i>was trying to avoid contact.</i>

902
01:09:04,761 --> 01:09:09,341
If she had known it was VX,
you know, the most lethal poison,

903
01:09:09,742 --> 01:09:12,985
she would surely not have
rubbed the palm of her hands.

904
01:09:14,633 --> 01:09:18,917
<i>WAN AZIRUL: The CCTV
recording clearly shows Doan</i>

905
01:09:18,942 --> 01:09:21,468
<i>WAN AZIRUL: and her hands
seemed very uncomfortable.</i>

906
01:09:24,353 --> 01:09:27,933
<i>DOAN:
I felt my hand oily and smelly</i>

907
01:09:30,004 --> 01:09:34,917
<i>DOAN: and I don't want it to
dirty my LOL white T-shirt.</i>

908
01:09:41,548 --> 01:09:43,257
<i>As Kim Jong-nam was dying,</i>

909
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:47,008
<i>these North Koreans,</i>

910
01:09:48,046 --> 01:09:50,673
they were subsequently seen in the CCTV

911
01:09:50,698 --> 01:09:53,639
going towards the toilet
and change their clothes.

912
01:09:57,322 --> 01:10:01,849
<i>Then they were immediately met by the
secretary of the North Korean embassy</i>

913
01:10:02,057 --> 01:10:04,555
<i>and the staff in the Air Koryo,</i>

914
01:10:05,041 --> 01:10:07,208
<i>who facilitated their easy</i>

915
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:09,605
<i>passage through the immigration.</i>

916
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:13,175
<i>If you look here at this moment,</i>

917
01:10:15,824 --> 01:10:17,790
<i>you can see them laughing.</i>

918
01:10:19,157 --> 01:10:20,866
<i>This is like within two hours</i>

919
01:10:20,867 --> 01:10:22,617
after they killed Kim Jong-nam.

920
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:26,589
<i>And then they flew immediately to Jakarta,</i>

921
01:10:26,614 --> 01:10:29,695
<i>the first flight they could
take to connect them to Dubai</i>

922
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:32,976
<i>and to Vladivostok and back to
Pyongyang, North Korea.</i>

923
01:10:36,461 --> 01:10:38,628
<i>The four North Koreans have escaped.</i>

924
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:41,394
<i>Ri Jong Choi,</i>

925
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,739
<i>the staff of the North Korean Embassy,</i>

926
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:45,933
<i>and the staff in the Air Koryo,</i>

927
01:10:45,934 --> 01:10:48,394
<i>all were allowed to go back to North Korea.</i>

928
01:10:49,322 --> 01:10:50,530
<i>And James,</i>

929
01:10:50,651 --> 01:10:52,795
<i>nobody knows where is James today.</i>

930
01:10:54,994 --> 01:10:57,208
All the North Koreans were untouched.

931
01:10:59,616 --> 01:11:01,376
<i>But somebody has got to be charged,</i>

932
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:03,492
<i>because somebody is dead.</i>

933
01:11:04,911 --> 01:11:06,287
<i>So the two girls,</i>

934
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:09,702
<i>they become scapegoats of the prosecution.</i>

935
01:11:17,628 --> 01:11:19,422
WAN SHAHARUDDIN WAN LADIN:

936
01:11:17,632 --> 01:11:19,672
We have presented our case,

937
01:11:20,051 --> 01:11:23,846
so now it is for them to
explain their conduct.

938
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:27,876
<i>The two lawyers mentioned that this
whole plot is a political conspiracy,</i>

939
01:11:27,901 --> 01:11:30,561
<i>that North Korea wants to murder...
it's not these two women.</i>

940
01:11:30,562 --> 01:11:32,313
I don't care.

941
01:11:32,839 --> 01:11:35,026
There is no evidence of political plot.

942
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:38,084
<i>The four North Koreans who ran away</i>

943
01:11:38,109 --> 01:11:40,485
<i>didn't apply the VX to the victim.</i>

944
01:11:40,864 --> 01:11:43,115
It's not important for us to prove.

945
01:11:47,024 --> 01:11:50,831
<i>For me, sitting through the
prosecution's stage of the trial,</i>

946
01:11:51,832 --> 01:11:54,138
<i>it is pretty clear that</i>

947
01:11:54,225 --> 01:11:56,332
<i>the prosecution, and by
extension, the government,</i>

948
01:11:56,690 --> 01:11:58,918
<i>want to convict these two women.</i>

949
01:12:01,103 --> 01:12:04,564
<i>In the international stage it would
look very bad for Malaysia to have</i>

950
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:07,262
<i>somebody of a high profile as</i>

951
01:12:07,402 --> 01:12:10,299
<i>Kim Jong-nam to be
murdered in broad daylight</i>

952
01:12:10,324 --> 01:12:13,285
<i>at its biggest international airport.</i>

953
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:16,644
<i>It's a big shame for the country.</i>

954
01:12:17,422 --> 01:12:21,217
So in a typical mentality of saving face,

955
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:25,215
<i>someone has to take the blame,
to take the fall for it.</i>

956
01:12:26,428 --> 01:12:29,881
<i>Just from a judicial point of view,
yes, these women were caught on camera</i>

957
01:12:29,906 --> 01:12:31,563
<i>carrying out this act.</i>

958
01:12:31,588 --> 01:12:36,966
They were very clearly the ones
who had assassinated, technically,

959
01:12:37,034 --> 01:12:38,300
Kim Jong-nam.

960
01:12:38,325 --> 01:12:41,786
So Malaysia did need to act,
did need to hold somebody to account,

961
01:12:42,006 --> 01:12:45,561
and the fact is that the masterminds
of it were back in North Korea.

962
01:12:54,221 --> 01:12:57,121
<i>So now the assassination
of Kim Jong-nam</i>

963
01:12:57,528 --> 01:13:01,059
<i>has been really fundamental
to phase one</i>

964
01:13:01,084 --> 01:13:03,725
<i>of Kim Jong-un's leadership</i>

965
01:13:04,276 --> 01:13:07,385
<i>and to the way that he has
been able to stay in power.</i>

966
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:12,230
<i>And once he had taken out
all his rivals,</i>

967
01:13:12,633 --> 01:13:14,897
<i>he had proven his strength
domestically...</i>

968
01:13:17,271 --> 01:13:18,894
He was ready for phase two.

969
01:13:20,745 --> 01:13:25,578
North Korea best not make any
more threats to the United States.

970
01:13:26,371 --> 01:13:30,524
They will be met
with fire and fury

971
01:13:30,933 --> 01:13:33,142
like the world has never seen.

972
01:13:34,154 --> 01:13:36,881
<i>He wanted to get
the world's attention.</i>

973
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:42,757
<i>I think now that he has proven he had
a credible nuclear weapons program,</i>

974
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:45,547
<i>he is now starting this process</i>

975
01:13:45,572 --> 01:13:50,818
<i>of trying to look like a
respectable international statesman</i>

976
01:13:50,965 --> 01:13:53,792
<i>and seems very strong
and very confident</i>

977
01:13:53,817 --> 01:13:56,500
<i>and very much in control
of this regime.</i>

978
01:14:06,172 --> 01:14:07,339
Hello.

979
01:14:09,429 --> 01:14:11,139
Okay, good.
Who is this, please?

980
01:14:12,917 --> 01:14:14,691
Ah, okay, all right,
all right, fine.

981
01:14:16,186 --> 01:14:18,538
<i>Now that the prosecution
has closed its case,</i>

982
01:14:18,563 --> 01:14:21,393
<i>how do you save your client
from execution at this point?</i>

983
01:14:22,553 --> 01:14:24,233
Look at the conduct.

984
01:14:25,077 --> 01:14:26,820
Two days after the incident,

985
01:14:27,503 --> 01:14:29,546
Doan went back to the airport

986
01:14:30,374 --> 01:14:32,584
again to the scene of crime.

987
01:14:34,984 --> 01:14:36,610
<i>Now the question is:</i>

988
01:14:37,465 --> 01:14:41,134
<i>assuming Doan is the assassin,
assuming she is the killer,</i>

989
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,013
<i>would she go back to the
airport two days later</i>

990
01:14:45,264 --> 01:14:48,224
<i>and be identified?
It doesn't makes sense, does it?</i>

991
01:14:50,566 --> 01:14:51,942
<i>This is Doan.</i>

992
01:14:52,472 --> 01:14:55,013
<i>She's coming back to the arrival hall.</i>

993
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,300
<i>You can see, she never cut her hair.</i>

994
01:15:00,839 --> 01:15:03,033
<i>She was wearing the same shoes.</i>

995
01:15:04,025 --> 01:15:05,359
She don't know

996
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,362
that someone called Kim Jong-nam has died,

997
01:15:08,456 --> 01:15:10,082
and police are looking for her.

998
01:15:12,325 --> 01:15:17,451
<i>DOAN: Mr. Y said today
make another video at KLIA.</i>

999
01:15:18,464 --> 01:15:21,337
<i>DOAN:
So I go there at 8 AM</i>

1000
01:15:21,444 --> 01:15:25,011
<i>DOAN:
and call and text him many times.</i>

1001
01:15:28,242 --> 01:15:31,349
<i>DOAN:
But he switch off his phone.</i>

1002
01:15:37,341 --> 01:15:39,759
Then, no choice,
she wanted to go back to the hotel.

1003
01:15:39,784 --> 01:15:42,481
She called for a taxi.

1004
01:16:02,578 --> 01:16:03,870
<i>The guards came.</i>

1005
01:16:04,869 --> 01:16:07,602
<i>And she was arrested by the authorities.</i>

1006
01:16:18,313 --> 01:16:22,399
<i>The prosecution's case was
closed on the 5th of April.</i>

1007
01:16:23,796 --> 01:16:25,843
<i>And meanwhile, the girls are incarcerated.</i>

1008
01:16:26,276 --> 01:16:29,763
<i>They have already been in
the jail for one and a half years.</i>

1009
01:16:31,631 --> 01:16:33,711
And that damage is irreparable.

1010
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:37,943
<i>In our criminal system here,</i>

1011
01:16:38,544 --> 01:16:41,072
<i>once the prosecution presents its case,</i>

1012
01:16:41,706 --> 01:16:45,042
the judge will have to
make a decision whether

1013
01:16:45,311 --> 01:16:49,237
<i>a case has been proven
against both of the girls.</i>

1014
01:16:55,013 --> 01:16:58,140
<i>The judge could either acquit the girls</i>

1015
01:16:58,733 --> 01:17:00,859
<i>or call for their defense.</i>

1016
01:17:04,793 --> 01:17:07,791
<i>JUDGE: My reading of my finding
will take quite some time.</i>

1017
01:17:07,816 --> 01:17:09,479
<i>JUDGE: So please bear with me.</i>

1018
01:17:09,504 --> 01:17:11,770
<i>JUDGE: There is bound to be unhappiness.</i>

1019
01:17:12,855 --> 01:17:14,481
It took two and a half hours

1020
01:17:15,448 --> 01:17:17,199
for the judgement to be delivered.

1021
01:17:18,016 --> 01:17:20,054
It was an eighty-two page judgement.

1022
01:17:21,079 --> 01:17:26,292
<i>JUDGE: The CCTV footage shows both women
holding their hands away from themselves.</i>

1023
01:17:26,626 --> 01:17:32,094
<i>JUDGE: To me, the precise timing and
the use of the VX as a chemical weapon</i>

1024
01:17:32,119 --> 01:17:37,518
<i>JUDGE: all goes to support that they knew that the
liquid placed on their hands were toxic substances.</i>

1025
01:17:39,358 --> 01:17:41,625
<i>I think that was the moment where I...</i>

1026
01:17:42,375 --> 01:17:45,045
on the margins of my notes I wrote that

1027
01:17:45,401 --> 01:17:46,708
they are fucked.

1028
01:17:50,548 --> 01:17:52,728
And I think these girls are going to hang.

1029
01:17:53,789 --> 01:17:56,309
<i>JUDGE: The sole purpose of prank is fun.</i>

1030
01:17:56,489 --> 01:17:59,529
<i>JUDGE: It is evident that none
of the features of "prank"</i>

1031
01:17:59,554 --> 01:18:03,332
<i>JUDGE: can be seen or found
to exist in the CCTV footage.</i>

1032
01:18:04,107 --> 01:18:06,774
<i>JUDGE: I find that the contention
that they were merely duped</i>

1033
01:18:06,799 --> 01:18:10,720
<i>JUDGE: into carrying out the act
could not possibly hold water.</i>

1034
01:18:11,284 --> 01:18:15,380
<i>JUDGE: I am of the firm view
that the accused persons</i>

1035
01:18:15,884 --> 01:18:20,794
<i>JUDGE: were the perpetrators
leading to the death of Kim Chol,</i>

1036
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:23,654
<i>JUDGE: and I must therefore call upon them</i>

1037
01:18:23,775 --> 01:18:27,034
<i>JUDGE: to enter their defense
on their respective charges.</i>

1038
01:18:28,386 --> 01:18:29,954
<i>How is your client feeling?</i>

1039
01:18:30,741 --> 01:18:33,721
She is obviously disappointed with
the ruling made by his Lordship.

1040
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:36,612
<i>Will you still try your defense
of the prank, given that--</i>

1041
01:18:36,613 --> 01:18:39,131
Oh, yes. That has been our

1042
01:18:39,728 --> 01:18:42,597
defense consistently
from day one until now.

1043
01:18:42,658 --> 01:18:45,064
And we will pursue it until
the end of the defense's case.

1044
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:47,849
<i>But the judge said it's not a prank
because nobody laughed?</i>

1045
01:18:47,874 --> 01:18:50,190
That is his finding at this point of time.

1046
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:52,183
He has not heard Doan.

1047
01:19:03,861 --> 01:19:05,594
<i>At this point of time,</i>

1048
01:19:05,818 --> 01:19:09,822
<i>Siti and Doan have been
in jail almost two years.</i>

1049
01:19:11,478 --> 01:19:16,644
I think the girls, um,
really have no one apart from each other.

1050
01:19:17,825 --> 01:19:21,385
<i>Because they are kept separately
from all other inmates.</i>

1051
01:19:22,053 --> 01:19:25,085
<i>Even then they are separated
from one another.</i>

1052
01:19:28,121 --> 01:19:32,833
<i>SITI: With Doan,
when we first entered the prison,</i>

1053
01:19:33,014 --> 01:19:36,376
<i>SITI:
she was asked by the Malaysian police</i>

1054
01:19:36,702 --> 01:19:39,174
<i>SITI:
which part of Vietnam she was from,</i>

1055
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:41,383
<i>SITI:
and she said, "Hanoi."</i>

1056
01:19:42,812 --> 01:19:45,645
<i>SITI:
I didn't know her name,</i>

1057
01:19:45,918 --> 01:19:49,645
<i>SITI:
so I called her "Noi" from Hanoi.</i>

1058
01:19:52,855 --> 01:19:57,728
<i>DOAN:
We have separate cells
so we cannot see each other.</i>

1059
01:20:00,161 --> 01:20:03,841
<i>DOAN:
We must talk louder to hear.</i>

1060
01:20:06,327 --> 01:20:08,829
<i>SITI: Sometimes when I was about to
eat, I would say,</i>

1061
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:10,480
<i>SITI:
"Hanoi, let's eat."</i>

1062
01:20:10,623 --> 01:20:11,790
<i>SITI:
And she would say the same thing,</i>

1063
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:13,667
<i>SITI:
"Okay, let's eat, Aisyah."</i>

1064
01:20:14,357 --> 01:20:18,070
<i>SITI:
After about a year in prison,</i>

1065
01:20:18,994 --> 01:20:24,674
<i>SITI:
I started to joke around more with Noi,</i>

1066
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:26,786
<i>SITI:
and chit-chat.</i>

1067
01:20:27,226 --> 01:20:30,006
<i>SITI: That was when we
started to be close friends.</i>

1068
01:20:32,855 --> 01:20:36,175
<i>DOAN:
Siti is very funny.</i>

1069
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:38,142
<i>DOAN:
Also very...</i>

1070
01:20:38,379 --> 01:20:39,796
<i>DOAN:
good heart.</i>

1071
01:20:40,785 --> 01:20:41,832
<i>DOAN:
Only...</i>

1072
01:20:41,857 --> 01:20:43,900
<i>DOAN:
me understand her and</i>

1073
01:20:44,641 --> 01:20:46,297
<i>DOAN:
her understand me.</i>

1074
01:20:48,196 --> 01:20:49,590
<i>DOAN:
We become</i>

1075
01:20:50,143 --> 01:20:53,884
<i>DOAN:
like sisters, become best friends.</i>

1076
01:20:55,057 --> 01:20:57,304
<i>DOAN:
When we together,</i>

1077
01:20:58,379 --> 01:21:01,077
<i>DOAN:
I can feel her heart.</i>

1078
01:21:03,310 --> 01:21:08,297
<i>DOAN:
That's why she can believe me
and I can believe her.</i>

1079
01:21:23,905 --> 01:21:26,138
<i>In preparation for the defense of Doan,</i>

1080
01:21:26,657 --> 01:21:29,125
<i>we spent about total
fourteen hours with her.</i>

1081
01:21:30,407 --> 01:21:33,480
<i>To go through her statement,
discuss the evidence with her.</i>

1082
01:21:34,593 --> 01:21:37,299
PRAYER ROOM

1083
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:44,998
<i>Doan is a bit anxious, obviously.</i>

1084
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:46,958
<i>A bit tense,</i>

1085
01:21:46,983 --> 01:21:50,126
<i>because today she is taking the stand for
the first time in her entire life.</i>

1086
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:57,512
<i>She is aware that her case will be watched
by people throughout the world.</i>

1087
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:02,986
<i>There will definitely be pressure on her.</i>

1088
01:22:08,552 --> 01:22:10,032
<i>But I think she...</i>

1089
01:22:10,613 --> 01:22:11,879
<i>she's prepared.</i>

1090
01:22:19,729 --> 01:22:22,549
<i>On Saturday, before the trial started,</i>

1091
01:22:22,681 --> 01:22:24,816
<i>my friend texted Gooi.</i>

1092
01:22:25,414 --> 01:22:27,290
And Gooi sent this

1093
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:29,361
rather vague

1094
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:31,169
text back to her

1095
01:22:31,194 --> 01:22:34,516
<i>saying, "Bring all your
team down on Monday.</i>

1096
01:22:34,804 --> 01:22:36,627
<i>There is going to be big news."</i>

1097
01:22:37,501 --> 01:22:38,813
Azura.

1098
01:22:40,062 --> 01:22:41,201
Azura.

1099
01:22:42,241 --> 01:22:44,122
<i>So I met with Selvi,</i>

1100
01:22:45,708 --> 01:22:48,369
throwing some guesses at her.

1101
01:22:49,156 --> 01:22:51,008
You guys found one of the North Koreans?

1102
01:22:51,033 --> 01:22:52,989
You guys are going to bring James here?

1103
01:22:53,085 --> 01:22:54,256
And she was like,

1104
01:22:55,194 --> 01:22:57,570
"I don't know. You just wait.
You just wait."

1105
01:23:00,502 --> 01:23:02,909
<i>The lead prosecutor Mohammad Iskandar Ahmad</i>

1106
01:23:02,962 --> 01:23:05,576
<i>got up, looked at the judge, and he said,</i>

1107
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:10,068
<i>PROSECUTOR: There's something that I
would like to address today, my Lord.</i>

1108
01:23:11,547 --> 01:23:14,713
<i>PROSECUTOR: I am requesting...</i>

1109
01:23:17,143 --> 01:23:18,810
<i>PROSECUTOR: Your honor, I...</i>

1110
01:23:20,029 --> 01:23:23,469
<i>PROSECUTOR: I request to withdraw</i>

1111
01:23:23,494 --> 01:23:26,078
<i>PROSECUTOR: the charge against Siti Aisyah.</i>

1112
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:30,791
I literally was like,

1113
01:23:31,624 --> 01:23:32,724
"What?!"

1114
01:23:33,827 --> 01:23:36,694
<i>The judge clearly looked surprised</i>

1115
01:23:36,943 --> 01:23:38,641
<i>that this happened,</i>

1116
01:23:39,436 --> 01:23:40,830
but then he said,

1117
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:44,392
<i>JUDGE: The court has
determined that Siti Aisyah,</i>

1118
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:47,172
<i>JUDGE: the first defendant,
is hereby released.</i>

1119
01:23:48,799 --> 01:23:50,092
<i>JUDGE: All right?</i>

1120
01:23:50,117 --> 01:23:51,465
<i>JUDGE: You can go.</i>

1121
01:23:53,596 --> 01:23:56,348
<i>I think Siti was trying to
process what was going on.</i>

1122
01:23:56,861 --> 01:24:00,274
<i>So she got up and grabbed
Doan and hugged her.</i>

1123
01:24:01,103 --> 01:24:02,580
<i>And then she left the courtroom.</i>

1124
01:24:12,918 --> 01:24:14,961
How are you feeling?

1125
01:24:14,986 --> 01:24:16,862
I feel...

1126
01:24:19,694 --> 01:24:22,075
I feel like I'm...

1127
01:24:23,394 --> 01:24:24,793
Did they tell you before?

1128
01:24:24,794 --> 01:24:27,003
- No, I didn't know.
- You just found out now?

1129
01:24:27,004 --> 01:24:28,004
Uh-huh.

1130
01:24:28,005 --> 01:24:29,506
I feel...

1131
01:24:29,507 --> 01:24:30,867
pretty surprised.

1132
01:24:57,775 --> 01:24:59,136
<i>Who was that? Aisyah?!</i>

1133
01:24:59,161 --> 01:25:00,161
<i>Oh my God!</i>

1134
01:25:00,162 --> 01:25:01,413
<i>What the hell just happened?</i>

1135
01:25:01,414 --> 01:25:05,083
Yeah, she was released without...

1136
01:25:12,124 --> 01:25:13,958
Today, the

1137
01:25:14,635 --> 01:25:16,511
prosecution informed the court that

1138
01:25:16,992 --> 01:25:20,145
they declined to further prosecute
the case against Siti Aisyah.

1139
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:23,335
So Siti Aisyah has been
discharged from the court today.

1140
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,278
The decision is...

1141
01:25:25,303 --> 01:25:29,074
The decision is the decision of the
attorney general, the public prosecutor to

1142
01:25:29,652 --> 01:25:32,028
decline to further prosecute.
No reasons were given.

1143
01:25:32,069 --> 01:25:33,653
What will happen next?

1144
01:25:35,136 --> 01:25:38,282
Next is that
she is a free person and

1145
01:25:38,603 --> 01:25:40,122
she will be going back to Jakarta.

1146
01:25:40,367 --> 01:25:42,201
What's going to happen to Doan?

1147
01:25:42,841 --> 01:25:43,901
Doan's case?

1148
01:25:43,926 --> 01:25:47,917
I believe since they did not indicate
anything, the case must continue.

1149
01:25:50,882 --> 01:25:53,816
<i>HISYAM: My lord, the accused person
will give evidence under oath.</i>

1150
01:25:53,841 --> 01:25:55,759
<i>HISYAM: We have prepared
a written statement.</i>

1151
01:25:56,573 --> 01:26:00,847
<i>DOAN: I, Doan Thi Huong, solemnly swear</i>

1152
01:26:00,871 --> 01:26:02,871
<i>DOAN: and promise the court...</i>

1153
01:26:03,893 --> 01:26:07,393
<i>Doan was pretty traumatized
with the whole experience.</i>

1154
01:26:08,731 --> 01:26:10,023
<i>She just saw</i>

1155
01:26:10,024 --> 01:26:12,891
the girl who was with her the whole time

1156
01:26:13,319 --> 01:26:14,597
being let go.

1157
01:26:16,758 --> 01:26:19,325
<i>And she just broke down and cried.</i>

1158
01:26:21,502 --> 01:26:23,669
<i>HISYAM: We'd like to make
a representation, my lord.</i>

1159
01:26:24,419 --> 01:26:27,838
<i>Her lawyers asked the Judge
for court to be adjourned.</i>

1160
01:26:33,881 --> 01:26:35,181
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1161
01:26:35,466 --> 01:26:37,842
<i>the charge against Siti
Aisyah was withdrawn,</i>

1162
01:26:37,843 --> 01:26:39,881
<i>whereas, as far as Doan is concerned,</i>

1163
01:26:40,262 --> 01:26:42,268
<i>the charge still remains the same.</i>

1164
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:45,235
Doan is obviously traumatized

1165
01:26:45,643 --> 01:26:48,019
that there's no fairness shown to her.

1166
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:51,436
She's entitled to the same
kind of considerations

1167
01:26:51,776 --> 01:26:55,429
that the public prosecutor decides to
withdraw the charge against Siti Aisyah.

1168
01:26:55,535 --> 01:26:57,421
Bearing in mind the
court has found as a fact

1169
01:26:57,446 --> 01:26:59,739
there's a case against
both of them to answer.

1170
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:06,095
To me, it's a mixed feeling.

1171
01:27:06,999 --> 01:27:09,826
We are happy for Siti Aisyah and yet we are

1172
01:27:09,930 --> 01:27:11,389
<i>sad for Doan.</i>

1173
01:27:13,029 --> 01:27:15,503
<i>The girls drew strength from one another.</i>

1174
01:27:16,710 --> 01:27:19,090
<i>To me it would be very hard for Doan</i>

1175
01:27:19,779 --> 01:27:21,410
<i>to go through the trial</i>

1176
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:24,199
<i>alone.</i>

1177
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:27,304
- Come, come.
- Azura, come.

1178
01:27:27,329 --> 01:27:28,606
One for my team.

1179
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:36,335
<i>In my heart I know Doan's innocent as well.</i>

1180
01:27:38,335 --> 01:27:41,762
<i>I've been a criminal lawyer
for the last 40 years.</i>

1181
01:27:44,633 --> 01:27:46,333
<i>Until today, I...</i>

1182
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:50,666
if you ask me what justice is, I still...

1183
01:27:53,210 --> 01:27:55,462
<i>I find it very difficult
to answer that question.</i>

1184
01:28:01,131 --> 01:28:04,724
<i>At first, it does appear to be coming out
of nowhere because nobody was expecting it.</i>

1185
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:08,243
<i>But later on we found out that</i>

1186
01:28:08,495 --> 01:28:10,103
Siti's discharge is

1187
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:13,315
based on the fact that the Indonesian
government has been

1188
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:15,743
putting constant pressure against
the Malaysian government.

1189
01:28:16,108 --> 01:28:20,874
There have been backchannel
discussions at a very high level

1190
01:28:20,899 --> 01:28:23,192
for the release of Siti Aisyah.

1191
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:27,545
<i>President Joko Widodo discussed
the issue of Siti Aisyah</i>

1192
01:28:27,782 --> 01:28:32,475
<i>with the Malaysian Prime Minister
at Bogor Palace in June 2018.</i>

1193
01:28:34,284 --> 01:28:38,924
<i>It makes sense what Indonesia is doing
to save their citizen Siti Aisyah.</i>

1194
01:28:40,287 --> 01:28:43,694
<i>But the same cannot be said
for the Vietnamese government,</i>

1195
01:28:44,316 --> 01:28:47,363
<i>who is not doing as much to defend Doan.</i>

1196
01:28:48,535 --> 01:28:52,320
Vietnam and North Korea continue
to have very close relations.

1197
01:28:52,351 --> 01:28:54,569
They're both communist
countries.

1198
01:28:55,654 --> 01:29:00,794
<i>And there's a lot of North
Korean activity inside Vietnam.</i>

1199
01:29:01,263 --> 01:29:04,439
<i>So I think Vietnam's incentive
to speak out</i>

1200
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:08,188
and to risk angering North Korea
for the sake of this one woman,

1201
01:29:08,213 --> 01:29:11,882
I think, was very different from
the situation that Indonesia faced,

1202
01:29:11,907 --> 01:29:17,008
whereas Indonesia doesn't have those
same strong relations with North Korea.

1203
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,751
<i>If previously the thought of</i>

1204
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,403
both of them going

1205
01:29:23,428 --> 01:29:24,573
to be hanged

1206
01:29:24,733 --> 01:29:26,427
for this murder

1207
01:29:26,985 --> 01:29:29,647
felt really unfair,

1208
01:29:31,638 --> 01:29:34,045
I feel it would be even worse

1209
01:29:34,682 --> 01:29:38,638
<i>if Doan were going to be hanged,</i>

1210
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:41,429
- Bye!
- Bye!

1211
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:43,857
<i>while Siti Aisyah goes back home.</i>

1212
01:30:01,672 --> 01:30:03,385
<i>We're just so happy.</i>

1213
01:30:05,639 --> 01:30:07,826
Just so glad.

1214
01:30:10,075 --> 01:30:11,928
Praise be to Allah.

1215
01:30:21,251 --> 01:30:24,211
<i>Certainly, I am so happy to be home,</i>

1216
01:30:24,236 --> 01:30:28,364
<i>and be with my family and friends.</i>

1217
01:30:31,193 --> 01:30:32,985
<i>But I am definitely still sad.</i>

1218
01:30:36,663 --> 01:30:38,414
<i>It's as if</i>

1219
01:30:39,543 --> 01:30:41,885
<i>those North Koreans saw me</i>

1220
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:45,366
<i>as if my life has no value whatsoever.</i>

1221
01:30:46,839 --> 01:30:50,519
<i>Like I am a nobody, a nothing.</i>

1222
01:30:58,395 --> 01:31:02,148
<i>Doan and I grew very close</i>

1223
01:31:02,347 --> 01:31:06,141
<i>over the course of the trial.</i>

1224
01:31:07,696 --> 01:31:10,239
I always gave my support to her,

1225
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:12,742
and she always gave her support to me.

1226
01:31:12,816 --> 01:31:14,389
When I cried...

1227
01:31:14,753 --> 01:31:16,466
when I cried,

1228
01:31:16,914 --> 01:31:19,540
she would always console me.

1229
01:31:22,652 --> 01:31:24,366
And when she cried,

1230
01:31:25,201 --> 01:31:26,992
I would do the same for her.

1231
01:31:30,321 --> 01:31:34,155
I think of her as my own sister.

1232
01:31:41,311 --> 01:31:45,431
<i>I pray she will not get the death penalty.</i>

1233
01:32:01,975 --> 01:32:04,548
<i>Doan has been very depressed. Confused.</i>

1234
01:32:06,166 --> 01:32:09,085
<i>We saw her at the prison
about two or three times.</i>

1235
01:32:10,779 --> 01:32:14,446
And two or three times she told
me that she would not testify.

1236
01:32:17,121 --> 01:32:18,942
<i>You see, the court has made a ruling.</i>

1237
01:32:19,277 --> 01:32:21,570
<i>The judge has called for the defense.</i>

1238
01:32:22,913 --> 01:32:25,748
<i>And the law says, if, after such ruling,</i>

1239
01:32:26,136 --> 01:32:27,980
<i>Doan decides not to testify,</i>

1240
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:30,755
she will be convicted
and sentenced to death:

1241
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:32,507
There's no other option whatsoever.

1242
01:32:43,068 --> 01:32:44,876
<i>So, upon arriving here this morning,</i>

1243
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:46,388
<i>one thing I noticed is</i>

1244
01:32:46,867 --> 01:32:49,756
<i>the presence of Vietnamese
officials from the embassy,</i>

1245
01:32:49,797 --> 01:32:52,173
<i>including the Vietnamese
Ambassador to Malaysia.</i>

1246
01:32:54,904 --> 01:32:56,914
Which, in a way, is

1247
01:32:57,114 --> 01:32:59,307
a ray of hope, I suppose for Doan.

1248
01:32:59,308 --> 01:33:01,267
But, at the same time,

1249
01:33:01,268 --> 01:33:02,977
it is still

1250
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:05,884
pretty much not clear what
is going to happen to her.

1251
01:33:07,961 --> 01:33:09,648
<i>The charges against her still stand</i>

1252
01:33:09,889 --> 01:33:14,294
<i>and her defense lawyers have tried to get
the Attorney General to change his mind.</i>

1253
01:33:15,113 --> 01:33:17,840
So, today we will find out whether

1254
01:33:18,233 --> 01:33:19,740
that would happen or not.

1255
01:33:33,653 --> 01:33:37,213
QUIET PLEASE.
COURT IS IN SESSION.

1256
01:34:05,517 --> 01:34:07,083
<i>How do you feel, Doan?</i>

1257
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:08,697
Thank you so much.

1258
01:34:12,998 --> 01:34:14,765
<i>- You're happy?</i>
- I'm happy.

1259
01:34:19,463 --> 01:34:20,844
Doan!

1260
01:34:28,219 --> 01:34:31,014
We feel very lucky and happy.

1261
01:34:31,081 --> 01:34:34,662
The family is very,
very lucky today and very happy.

1262
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:36,493
Thank you very much.

1263
01:34:37,932 --> 01:34:40,352
<i>So instead of facing a murder charge,</i>

1264
01:34:40,899 --> 01:34:43,744
she is being offered to

1265
01:34:44,209 --> 01:34:47,711
<i>plead guilty to a charge of causing harm,</i>

1266
01:34:48,458 --> 01:34:51,919
which is a much lesser offense than murder.

1267
01:34:53,019 --> 01:34:56,586
<i>Would you say it is finally
a happy ending for everyone?</i>

1268
01:34:57,509 --> 01:35:00,761
We are happy this morning that
it's come to a happy ending,

1269
01:35:00,762 --> 01:35:04,311
that Doan can look forward - there's a
date for her that she can go back home.

1270
01:35:04,336 --> 01:35:06,055
And that day is very near.

1271
01:35:19,248 --> 01:35:21,437
One minute, one minute.
Take their photo.

1272
01:35:21,462 --> 01:35:22,888
One, two...

1273
01:35:24,270 --> 01:35:27,032
- Okay. Nice. Very good.
- Thank you.

1274
01:35:35,515 --> 01:35:37,612
Take off the specs.

1275
01:35:38,184 --> 01:35:43,314
<i>What did you think about the most
while you were in custody?</i>

1276
01:35:44,054 --> 01:35:46,057
I thought about my parents,

1277
01:35:46,454 --> 01:35:50,061
I thought about my country and
how much I wanted to come home.

1278
01:35:50,086 --> 01:35:52,951
<i>What do you want to do
now that you're back?</i>

1279
01:35:53,571 --> 01:35:55,650
I don't know what to do yet,

1280
01:35:55,651 --> 01:35:58,464
but I think I'd like to perform.

1281
01:36:00,072 --> 01:36:02,998
Like an actress. That's what I want.

1282
01:36:06,801 --> 01:36:08,295
Thank you.

1283
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,201
Thank you, see you later.

1284
01:36:12,052 --> 01:36:14,985
Thank you, I'm very happy now.
Thank you so much.

1285
01:36:16,324 --> 01:36:17,809
Yeah. Yes.

1286
01:36:22,095 --> 01:36:24,061
<i>It is in a way a bittersweet ending.</i>

1287
01:36:27,599 --> 01:36:29,732
Seeing now that the two women are home.

1288
01:36:31,382 --> 01:36:34,022
<i>Both families have their
daughters back safely.</i>

1289
01:36:35,959 --> 01:36:38,269
<i>But I don't think their
lives will ever be the same.</i>

1290
01:36:41,646 --> 01:36:45,866
<i>I only learned about Kim
Jong-nam and Kim Jong-un</i>

1291
01:36:45,993 --> 01:36:48,661
<i>after coming back to Indonesia.</i>

1292
01:36:50,545 --> 01:36:54,417
I searched and read about
my case from the start,

1293
01:36:54,418 --> 01:36:56,085
how everything happened,

1294
01:36:56,238 --> 01:36:58,337
and saw photos of Kim Jong-nam.

1295
01:36:58,338 --> 01:37:00,434
"Oh, this is Kim Jong-nam, Kim Jong-un."

1296
01:37:00,674 --> 01:37:02,368
It's only now...

1297
01:37:02,596 --> 01:37:05,640
only now that I really understand.

1298
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:14,335
<i>I never imagined</i>

1299
01:37:15,272 --> 01:37:19,598
<i>that I could be involved in his murder.</i>

1300
01:37:23,091 --> 01:37:25,231
I feel really sorry for him.

1301
01:37:26,002 --> 01:37:27,502
Really sorry.

1302
01:37:35,890 --> 01:37:39,726
- Hello, Noi?
- <i>Oh yeah, yes?</i>

1303
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:41,789
What are you doing?

1304
01:37:42,103 --> 01:37:43,716
Okay. I want to -

1305
01:37:43,717 --> 01:37:46,552
I want to see you. I miss you.

1306
01:37:46,553 --> 01:37:47,928
<i>I miss you too.</i>

1307
01:37:54,097 --> 01:37:56,974
<i>When I came back, a lot of difficult,</i>

1308
01:37:57,832 --> 01:37:59,458
<i>a lot of media and</i>

1309
01:37:59,804 --> 01:38:01,567
<i>talking. People talking.</i>

1310
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:10,784
<i>People don't know me and Siti.</i>

1311
01:38:11,536 --> 01:38:12,636
<i>People...</i>

1312
01:38:15,382 --> 01:38:18,602
<i>just watching on the television.</i>

1313
01:38:19,205 --> 01:38:20,595
<i>People don't know</i>

1314
01:38:21,143 --> 01:38:24,122
<i>how difficult time we have had.</i>

1315
01:38:27,061 --> 01:38:28,801
Before, I think

1316
01:38:29,388 --> 01:38:31,389
the world is pink color.

1317
01:38:32,808 --> 01:38:36,143
The pink world is very
beautiful and colorful. Right?

1318
01:38:36,995 --> 01:38:39,348
And all people is good people.

1319
01:38:40,553 --> 01:38:44,848
But now I can see more clear.

1320
01:38:48,845 --> 01:38:51,844
<i>I can see the real world is not pink.</i>

1321
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:56,110
<i>I will be careful in my life</i>

1322
01:38:56,998 --> 01:38:59,834
<i>to trust people.</i>

1323
01:39:02,791 --> 01:39:04,151
<i>It's the end of</i>

1324
01:39:04,896 --> 01:39:06,814
<i>the journey for these two women.</i>

1325
01:39:08,727 --> 01:39:12,187
But is what happened
over the last two years,

1326
01:39:13,088 --> 01:39:14,963
can we say this is justice?

1327
01:39:15,821 --> 01:39:18,160
<i>And is there ever going to be justice for</i>

1328
01:39:18,551 --> 01:39:20,294
<i>the late Kim Jong-nam?</i>

1329
01:39:25,601 --> 01:39:27,990
<i>For all the international
condemnation and shock</i>

1330
01:39:28,015 --> 01:39:30,015
<i>that followed this
assassination,</i>

1331
01:39:30,681 --> 01:39:34,928
you know, North Korea has got away
relatively scot-free from this.

1332
01:39:36,742 --> 01:39:39,201
<i>In many ways,
this is the perfect crime.</i>

1333
01:39:40,145 --> 01:39:45,591
<i>The fact that Kim Jong-un was prepared
to purge and execute his brother,</i>

1334
01:39:45,858 --> 01:39:48,000
<i>in this most spectacular fashion,</i>

1335
01:39:48,138 --> 01:39:52,215
<i>sent a message to the world that
his brutality knows no limits,</i>

1336
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:53,966
<i>that nobody is safe.</i>

1337
01:39:56,326 --> 01:39:59,506
<i>The North Koreans never suffered
any punishment for this.</i>

1338
01:39:59,946 --> 01:40:02,994
<i>North Korea still has
an embassy in Malaysia.</i>

1339
01:40:03,019 --> 01:40:06,477
<i>You know, the relations between
them have not really suffered</i>

1340
01:40:06,502 --> 01:40:08,067
<i>as a result of this.</i>

1341
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:10,920
<i>And Kim Jong-un,</i>

1342
01:40:12,029 --> 01:40:14,854
<i>he has been able
to come to the outside world.</i>

1343
01:40:16,304 --> 01:40:20,835
<i>And he gets his red carpet welcome
on the dais with the flags.</i>

1344
01:40:21,091 --> 01:40:24,385
<i>He gets the photo opportunity
to show himself</i>

1345
01:40:24,410 --> 01:40:26,516
<i>as an international statesman.</i>

1346
01:40:28,538 --> 01:40:33,098
<i>And now, all of a sudden,
he gets to present himself</i>

1347
01:40:33,518 --> 01:40:37,526
<i>as a peer of the most powerful
man in the world.</i>

1348
01:40:38,913 --> 01:40:41,541
<i>I just received a
beautiful letter from Kim Jong-un.</i>

1349
01:40:41,566 --> 01:40:45,099
I can't show you the letter,
obviously, but it was a very personal,

1350
01:40:45,124 --> 01:40:46,866
very warm, very nice letter.

1351
01:40:46,891 --> 01:40:51,430
<i>I saw the information about the CIA
with respect to his half-brother.</i>

1352
01:40:51,619 --> 01:40:56,337
And I would tell him that would not
happen under my... under my auspices.

1353
01:40:57,820 --> 01:41:01,842
<i>So this is the way that Kim
Jong-un has defied all the skepticism</i>

1354
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:05,435
and shown that he is, you know,
surprisingly adept

1355
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:08,426
at being a totalitarian leader.

1356
01:41:10,771 --> 01:41:14,424
<i>And I think these two women
were very unwitting pawns</i>

1357
01:41:14,449 --> 01:41:16,131
<i>in this bigger chess game.</i>

1358
01:41:20,427 --> 01:41:22,720
<i>I'm sorry about everything.</i>

1359
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:25,310
<i>I hope</i>

1360
01:41:25,815 --> 01:41:28,257
<i>people in the world will think</i>

1361
01:41:28,906 --> 01:41:31,353
<i>me and Siti like</i>

1362
01:41:32,696 --> 01:41:34,989
<i>your friends, like</i>

1363
01:41:35,378 --> 01:41:37,529
<i>your daughters, like</i>

1364
01:41:38,168 --> 01:41:39,768
<i>your sisters.</i>

1365
01:41:49,189 --> 01:41:54,109
<i>When I was in Kajang Prison,</i>

1366
01:41:55,427 --> 01:41:59,920
<i>I'd be lying down falling asleep,</i>

1367
01:41:59,995 --> 01:42:03,622
<i>and I would stare out the window.</i>

1368
01:42:05,186 --> 01:42:07,508
<i>It was way high up on the wall.</i>

1369
01:42:14,334 --> 01:42:17,127
<i>I would pray as I gazed at the sky,</i>

1370
01:42:18,633 --> 01:42:22,844
<i>"Oh Allah, will I ever see the sky again,</i>

1371
01:42:23,481 --> 01:42:26,214
<i>in all its vastness?"</i>
