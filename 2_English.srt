1
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,980
For years I was frustrated

2
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,730
by what seemed to be
the insurmountable barriers

3
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:14,313
between the world as it is
and the world I wanted.

4
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,365
So, I began making a website

5
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,784
where people could buy and sell
anything anonymously.

6
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,157
He's on the move, got his laptop with him.

7
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,849
Which way is he coming?

8
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:26,544
Right at you.

9
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,003
Blue hoodie, jeans, flip-flops.

10
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,297
On foot, westbound
towards the target location.

11
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,384
I'm letting him go,
confirm when you have a visual.

12
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,298
I knew the state
might try to impede it.

13
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,471
But if we never try
for fear of retribution,

14
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,719
then we've already lost, you know?

15
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:49,273
Silk road is about something much bigger
than thumbing your nose at the man.

16
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,561
It's about taking back our Liberty.

17
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,192
And as corny as it sounds,

18
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,320
I just wanna look back at my life

19
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,653
and know that I did something
that helped people.

20
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,372
Nobody moves until my go.
He doesn't log in, we abort.

21
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,020
- Copy.
- And I repeat,

22
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:11,003
he closes the laptop,
the data's encrypted and we got shit.

23
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,449
Roger that, out.

24
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,695
Everybody on point here,
heads on a swivel.

25
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,710
Jj

26
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,813
Aggress, collapse and contain.
Stand by for takedown.

27
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,652
Hey, who the fuck is calling him?

28
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,868
Hello?

29
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,950
Jj

30
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,613
- Keep it running.
- I'll be here.

31
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,831
Fuck this fucking shit.

32
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,639
- How you doing?
- Hey.

33
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,017
Uh, give me a pack of camels, please.

34
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,105
Mm.

35
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,639
Something else?

36
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,777
- Mints. You got any mints?
- Yeah, right behind you, lower shelf.

37
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,654
Rick bowden. What's up, yo?
When you get out?

38
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,492
'Cause I heard you was in the...
Booby hatch. Ha.

39
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,077
First off, rayford, I was in, uh...

40
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,704
I was in rehab, not a psych ward.

41
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,336
Oh, well, I heard it was rehab,
then it was a psych ward.

42
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,008
Really?

43
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,551
Yeah, who told you that?

44
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,175
Clocked your digital footprint.

45
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,269
Well, it was good
to see you, brother.

46
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,811
I ain't your fucking brother.

47
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,936
Oh, why you do me like that, yo?
We... we friends, right?

48
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,439
I don't have fucking friends,
I have informants.

49
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,067
- Oh, fuck this, dude, I'm...
- Your cigarettes?

50
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,402
I don't want no fucking cigarettes, man.

51
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,537
- Motherfucker so angry, yo.
- Get all kinds in here.

52
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,710
Where them hot cheetos at, bro?

53
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,966
Unless you're a postal worker,

54
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,544
you're not allowed to dress
like one, even on Halloween.

55
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,095
Defacing the dollar bill,
consorting with a known pirate.

56
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,348
Technically, these are all crimes
against the state.

57
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,726
Right now there are
5,000 criminal statutes.

58
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,729
And that's just at the national level.
Forget about the states.

59
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,310
Until 1967,

60
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:26,364
it was illegal for a white man to marry
a black woman in the state of Virginia.

61
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,909
In 14 other states, including
the great state of Texas, mind you,

62
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:34,706
it was illegal for two people
to have consensual sodomy until 2002.

63
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,997
America has lost its compass, man.

64
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,816
If you wanna fall in love with someone
who doesn't look like you

65
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,503
or have sex with somebody who does,
that is your inalienable right.

66
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:49,421
I thought we were talking about obamacare.
What the fuck are you talking about?

67
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,724
Look, it doesn't matter how
well-intentioned the president is, man.

68
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,679
The state cannot legislate
what the person can and can't do.

69
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,309
It is un-American.

70
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,733
And next, they're gonna come for our guns
and giving them to the border crossers.

71
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,435
Am I right?

72
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,896
- Uh, who the fuck is this guy?
- Case in point.

73
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,358
A perfect stranger wants to butt in
on a private conversation between friends

74
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,364
with an inane, ignorant non sequitur,

75
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,492
his right to do so
is constitutionally-protected.

76
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,662
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

77
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,085
- You believe this asshole?
- Well, the first amendment.

78
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,044
Out of your league.

79
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,215
You wanna dance?

80
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,801
No one else is.

81
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,268
Exactly.

82
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,402
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

83
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,742
Uh, we were gonna pick you up.

84
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,911
I didn't want Edie to see me
in that place.

85
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,618
Okay.

86
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,833
- Welcome home.
- Ah.

87
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,749
- Hey, so we are clear...
- Daddy! Hey!

88
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,923
- Oh!
- Hey! Look who's here!

89
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,715
I missed my peanut. Oh, come here.

90
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:17,009
Come here, let me look at you.
I missed you.

91
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,889
I missed you more.

92
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,434
You're just beautiful. You sure are.

93
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,691
Come on, let's just take these inside.

94
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,173
Let's go and make necklaces, come on.

95
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,424
Let's do matching ones, let's do...

96
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,359
- Two yellows, two blues. Yeah?
- Okay.

97
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,910
House looks good.

98
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,234
You look good.

99
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,247
Huh?

100
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,281
Two yellows.

101
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,705
What's that? Huh?

102
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,774
Come on, I thought we said
we were gonna do matching.

103
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,663
- It's matching. Isn't it?
- No, it's not.

104
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,589
We got a green and a brown.

105
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,087
What did... should we do two browns
and two Greens then, yeah?

106
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,181
Sure.

107
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,840
You okay?

108
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,015
Yeah.

109
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,306
Matching, isn't it?

110
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,892
Come on, come here.

111
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,602
Sweetie, hey.

112
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,688
You know what'd be super fun?

113
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,989
Do you wanna go set up
a tea party for dad in your room?

114
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,112
He loves tea.

115
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,318
Yeah.

116
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,868
It's a thing. The school called
and we have to get her tested.

117
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,419
- Tested? No.
- Yeah.

118
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,997
No, we're not getting her tested.
Are you kidding me? Come on.

119
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,612
- Honey, she's a late bloomer.
- It's a learning disorder, Rick.

120
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,339
- It's a real thing, okay?
- Oh.

121
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,170
I've been here, okay,
you haven't been here.

122
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,185
I'm the one raising her right now.

123
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,139
Look, honey, you know...

124
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,268
I lost my way a little.

125
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,149
Okay? But I'm back. And I'm...

126
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,362
I'm gonna be here for you and Edie, okay?

127
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,449
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

128
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:55,941
Hmm? Hmm?

129
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,195
You do it again,
you don't bother coming back.

130
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,281
Jj

131
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,900
Hey.

132
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,725
Two plates? What are you, a monk?

133
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,811
No, it's an experiment.

134
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,405
I don't have anything
because I don't need anything.

135
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,825
Okay, well,

136
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,200
besides from living like a homeless
person, what's your deal?

137
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,414
Um...

138
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,082
Well, I'm almost a physicist.

139
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,750
I never quite got to...

140
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,998
- That's not what I mean.
- Actual physics...

141
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,962
- Honestly?
- Always.

142
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,218
Okay.

143
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:05,135
I don't really wanna say.
To be honest, it sounds corny.

144
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,269
Try me.

145
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,939
Okay. Um...

146
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,612
Ever since I can remember,
I've always wanted to change the world.

147
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,325
How?

148
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,369
Um...

149
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,743
Are you familiar with Ludwig Von mises?
Austrian school of economics?

150
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,199
- Um, no.
- Okay.

151
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,785
Most people aren't,
but his ideas are beautiful.

152
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,587
It's like poetry or math.

153
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,337
- I'm wilting, rossman.
- Okay.

154
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,418
In a sentence,

155
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,845
every action that we take
outside of government control

156
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,843
strengthens the market
and weakens the state.

157
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,185
- Seriously?
- Yes.

158
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,100
I just fucked a libertarian?

159
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,899
Surprise.

160
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,982
Jj

161
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,129
Fucking morales, eh?

162
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,122
- Mi hombre, huh.
- Come here.

163
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:24,639
- Fucked up out there, Johnny.
- I know that.

164
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,809
Well, we kept you in too long.
You went native. That's on us.

165
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,602
No, man, I should've...

166
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,475
I'm a big boy, I can take it.

167
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,228
I should've fucking put the hand up
and said, "yo, man, over here.

168
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,402
Not fucking... not waving around.”

169
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,900
- So I'll ride the bench a while.
- Rick...

170
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,194
Come on, man, I can work bocelli
behind a desk, I can...

171
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,329
You wrapped a car around a tree
in old San Juan, man.

172
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,407
I also took a narco predator
off the streets, too.

173
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,562
You might wanna mention that.

174
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:54,440
What about when I listen to the wire,
and then I find out that the whole thing,

175
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:58,377
it jumped off because you told Gomez
he was retarded?

176
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,523
I mean, what the fuck, you know?

177
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,241
You want me to fucking say, man?
You listen...

178
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,302
Rick, maybe I'm not making myself clear.

179
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,913
No, man, maybe
I'm not makin' myself clear.

180
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,039
- Rick...
- I ride the bench for a while.

181
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,519
You tell me how long...

182
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:16,316
You were coked out of your fucking mind,
endangering the lives of civilians.

183
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,063
You're never working the streets again.

184
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,645
- What the fuck does that mean?
- What do you think it means?

185
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,656
It's what I do, Johnny. It's who I am,
man, I mean, come on.

186
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,576
Fucking look at me!
I'm a fucking door kicker, man.

187
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,158
Read it. Read this shit.

188
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,712
Fuck sakes, man. The brass,
they wanted you out on your ass.

189
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,915
No pension. No nothing.

190
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,221
You're being reassigned, man.
Cybercrimes.

191
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,924
See gs shields on Monday.
He'll get you squared away.

192
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,848
Jj

193
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,453
Mm.

194
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,947
It was really good.

195
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,038
So how's the book business?

196
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,126
Sold the bus.

197
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,498
Well, that seems a bit drastic, love.

198
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,176
No, mom... good wagon
just was not the thing.

199
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,088
Really wasn't.

200
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,766
Give it a shot.

201
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,440
Come on. Let's see if you still got it.

202
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,737
I'm not a trained monkey, dad.

203
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,203
When Ross was nine,
he was consumed with the idea

204
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,076
of making the guinness book
of world records.

205
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,450
- What was it, eight seconds?
- 6.8.

206
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,161
We trained every day for three months.

207
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,496
And then the night before,

208
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:06,676
Ross abruptly decides it wasn't the thing.

209
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,343
Phd, a video game start-up,
now good wagon.

210
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,267
- Tell me when you see a pattern.
- Let's go.

211
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,977
It was really good.

212
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,901
Thanks, honey.
Yeah, it was nice to meet you.

213
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,236
Are you okay?

214
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,874
Yeah.

215
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,203
You sure?

216
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,411
Yes, yes. I'm fine.

217
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,292
Look, just because your dad's a dick

218
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,143
doesn't mean
that you won't change the world.

219
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,376
I believe in you, rossman.

220
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,462
Jj

221
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:36,841
Hey.

222
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,719
I'm after supervisor shields.

223
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:40,974
Yeah, I'm shields.

224
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,394
Rick bowden. Johnny morales sent me.

225
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,550
It's an honor to meet you, bowden.
We're glad to have you.

226
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,859
- It's good to be here.
- Yeah.

227
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,316
Yeah, sorry I'm late.
I hit the range, little tune up.

228
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,526
I gotta re-qualify.

229
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,407
Can I ask you
a personal question, Rick?

230
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,498
Yeah.

231
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,450
Is it true what happened
in, uh, Puerto Rico?

232
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,954
What part?

233
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,785
Eighteen-month op went sideways

234
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,463
when you told the cartel boss
he was a mongoloid?

235
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,209
So we got an open floor plan.

236
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,169
Foster inter-squad exchange.

237
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,970
But Johnny said you were old school.

238
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,264
Thought you might prefer some privacy.

239
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,593
So we got you in here. This little number.

240
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:29,228
We got a series 9, 16 gigs of ram,
intel processor. She's a rocket.

241
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,402
Ram up, huh?

242
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:36,655
Yeah. Ram up. Well,
welcome to cybercrimes, bowden.

243
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,497
You can do this.

244
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,835
Okay, real talk.
Good wagon was never gonna work.

245
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,383
Brick and mortar is dead.
We live in a convenience culture.

246
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,426
Everyone wants everything
shipped to their door.

247
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,425
And bezos already beat you to it.

248
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,757
Now, today's moneymaker is social

249
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,954
because everyone wants to know
what everyone else is up to.

250
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,970
- Like I said it would.
- No. Bullshit. That is bullshit.

251
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,647
People want anonymity.
Now more than ever.

252
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,568
The Internet was spawned off of the things
that people try and keep secret.

253
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,193
Think about it.
Porn, gambling, drugs.

254
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,992
Okay, but you can't buy drugs
on the Internet, Ross.

255
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,286
Hmm. I've been thinking about this.

256
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,076
What if you could?

257
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,375
Uh, what are you saying?

258
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,750
Think about it. Amazon for drugs.

259
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,421
- You despise Amazon.
- But I love freedom.

260
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:38,551
Yeah, well, whoever does this,
they're an idiot, first off,

261
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,303
and second off,
they'd be busted in, like, two seconds.

262
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,930
Not if every transaction's encrypted.

263
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,262
What do you know about Tor?

264
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,268
- What, the onion router?
- Nothing.

265
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,771
Uh, it was designed by the spooks
at DARPA and the Navy.

266
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,978
It's a network that directs web traffic
through a series of relays.

267
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,073
What for?

268
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,861
Concealing location and usage.

269
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,034
Essentially,
it's a digital invisibility cloak.

270
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,737
It's perfect for doing business
on the dark web.

271
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,993
Okay, but if they follow the money,

272
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,325
then you're fucked, right?

273
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,330
Bitcoin.

274
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,457
- Bitcoin.
- Bitcoin?

275
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,750
Bitcoin.

276
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,173
Bitcoin?

277
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,752
It's like tokens in an arcade.

278
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,758
You go into the arcade,
you buy the tokens,

279
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,181
but nobody knows which tokens you used.

280
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,413
- Okay, it's a little...
- It's completely anonymous transactions.

281
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,804
- Think about it.
- It's a little basic explanation,

282
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,889
- uh, but...
- I like tokens.

283
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,895
And I like drugs.

284
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,880
Okay,
so the first thing you need to do

285
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,941
is go to www.torproject.org.

286
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,901
Go to the link in the description, guys,
click the download Tor button.

287
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,452
Tell me
that's not a YouTube tutorial.

288
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,246
It's not like they're giving
classes at ut, babe.

289
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,042
Welcome
to "an introduction to the Internet.”

290
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,038
If you're not comfortable
with your computer,

291
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,418
you may need to play this tape many times.

292
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:02,054
Using your pointer finger,
rest it on the left button.

293
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,971
Press down and you will see a menu bar.

294
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,140
Press down
and you will see a menu bar.

295
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,267
Press down and you will see a menu bar.

296
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,586
Press down and you will...

297
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,146
Motherfucker!

298
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,227
Jj

299
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,281
I didn't know
you knew how to write code.

300
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,490
I don't, but I'm teaching myself.

301
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,164
I'm not gonna get up from this computer
until I've mastered it.

302
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:38,591
All right. Enjoy your nerd shit.
I'm gonna go get tacos.

303
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,557
Where you guys at on bocelli? Huh?

304
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,681
- Uh-uh.
- Oh, fuck that, come on, where you at?

305
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,888
It's an eyes-only briefing,
Rick. You know the drill.

306
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,252
Boss, we could really use
one of bowden's informants right now.

307
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,767
He's not running any. He's in cybercrimes.

308
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,895
Come on.

309
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,819
Okay.

310
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,037
Hey.

311
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:19,801
What is it?

312
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:21,963
Open it.

313
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,059
- It's a book.
- It's a little more than that.

314
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,596
Open it.

315
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,813
You bought drugs from yourself.

316
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,189
I had to beta test it.

317
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,153
By committing a felony?
Congratulations.

318
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,484
No. You're missing it.

319
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:52,074
Look, I am using the Internet
as an instrument of Liberty.

320
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,829
But that's illegal, Ross.

321
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,661
But the war on drugs is a farce.
This is America.

322
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,917
If you wanna smoke a bowl, snort a line,

323
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,545
pop a pill, that is your prerogative.

324
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:06,755
And now, thanks
to underground brokers, you can.

325
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,305
Underground brokers?

326
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,723
That's the name of the site.

327
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,511
Okay, aside from it being a terrible name,

328
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,348
dare you sure
you wanna go through with this?

329
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,519
You don't like the name?

330
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,319
That's all you heard?
That's all you're taking away?

331
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,397
You are so loving yourself, don't you?

332
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,276
Jj

333
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,828
Buyers guide.
If you are reading this now,

334
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,124
you have at least figured out
how to access a Tor hidden service.

335
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,831
Good job. Smiley face.

336
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,756
The currency used to buy and sell
stuff on this site is bitcoin.

337
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:47,132
No personal information
is associated with your bitcoins at all,

338
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,680
making them ideal
for anonymous transactions.

339
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,641
The first step to placing an order

340
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,266
is selecting the items you wanna purchase
by adding them to your shopping cart.

341
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,892
Now you can just kick back
ahd wait for it to arrive.

342
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,692
Receiving packages.
Use a different address

343
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,694
than the one where your items
will be kept,

344
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:10,492
such as a friend's house, or a po box.

345
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,864
Final note. Our commitment
is total satisfaction

346

349
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,220
Cocksucker.

350
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,844
- Yes, Rick.
- Dude, look at this, man.

351
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,625
I think it has
a fucking virus or something.

352
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,435
I swear to god, every time I try to hit,

353
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,087
well, it says, it just...

354
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,397
What is "undeliverable message"?
What is that?

355
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:48,231
Well, Rick, okay, I know you're having
a hard time adapting.

356
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,567
Okay, and I get it's weird, it's weird,
dude, having a 26-year-old boss.

357
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,698
Frankly, it's pretty odd for me, too.

358
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,747
But you can't call me in here every day
for tech support.

359
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,827
I'm running 17 active investigations.
I simply don't have the time. All right?

360
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,286
Yeah, well, I apologize.

361
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,793
Just trying to find,
you know, find my place.

362
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,946
All right, Rick,
I'm just gonna be straight with you,

363
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,962
because that's what
Johnny morales suggested.

364
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,468
You don't have to do squat.

365
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,642
Like, you can just kind of sit back,

366
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:21,098
watch old orioles games or, I don't know,
whatever it is you're into.

367
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,649
And in nine months,
you can retire with full pension.

368
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,479
So, that's it, huh? Just...

369
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,815
Rick, okay, I've got an Ace team
of twentysomethings out there,

370
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,196
fresh out of mit, Cal tech.

371
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:35,824
They're making
financial cases that, frankly,

372
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,871
you wouldn't even understand, okay?

373
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,448
But you know what?

374
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,829
You don't have to, okay?
So just relax, it...

375
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,834
I was locking up bad guys since before you
started shaving your fucking nuts.

376
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,666
Now, I maybe old and slow...

377
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,259
But I ain't stupid.

378
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,433
I'm glad we understand each other.

379
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,307
Jj

380
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,203
Yo, rayford!

381
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,663
Come on, man, get in the car.

382
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,921
Come on, shit, dude, don't be like that.
I thought we were friends.

383
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,469
Oh, now we friends?
Fuck you, bowden.

384
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,636
Come on, rayford,
get in the fucking car, dude. Huh?

385
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,978
I ain't gonna fucking bite.

386
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,434
There you go.

387
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,111
I'm out the game, yo,
I don't sling no more.

388
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,324
- What's in the box? Show me.
- It's just sneakers, yo.

389
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,782
- Open the fucking box, dude.
- Sneakers. You see?

390
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,494
- Hey. Tut-tut-tut-tut.
- No, don't touch that. Come on, yo.

391
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,085
No shit, huh?

392
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,885
- That's what you do.
- Yeah, sneakers, thank you.

393
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,339
I need a solid, dude.

394
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,514
- Solid? No. No.
- Yeah.

395
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,432
I'm not doing
no more Rick bowden solids, yo.

396
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,680
- No?
- No.

397
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,106
See, I'm remembering a night
at 1:00 A.M. in the morning

398
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:32,277
when I got a call that you'd been picked
up by the Baltimore pd.

399
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,104
And I got out of bed, drove down...

400
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,653
Got there by 2:00

401
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:39,611
and saved your little black ass
from getting violated.

402
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,099
Yo, what's the solid, yo? What you need?

403
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,580
Oh, gonna need a little bit more
manners than that, dude.

404
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,578
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

405
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,668
What do you need, yo?

406
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,166
You might not know it, but...

407
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,003
But dudes are buying and selling narcotics
on the computers.

408
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,713
There was a reshuffle at work and I got
promoted and put into cybercrimes, so...

409
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,512
I need someone to show me
how to buy dope on YouTube.

410
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,683
Can you do that?

411
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,103
Buy dope where?

412
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,805
On YouTube.

413
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,184
What, did I say it wrong?

414
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,958
Fucking tube,
whatever the fuck tube it is,

415
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,486
I need to buy it off it.

416
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:18,111
Oh, shit. Yo, you have
no fucking idea, yo.

417
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,362
Well, that's...

418
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,036
Oh, shit. You gonna buy dope on YouTube.

419
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,954
Yeah, let's get, uh, some meth on Google.

420
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,158
Just back the fuck up, dude.

421
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,230
- You wanna get some fucking...
- Do you know what an informant is?

422
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,121
For sure. Imma inform you that you don't
buy dope on YouTube.

423
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,027
I'm gonna inform you
that I'm gonna fucking shoot

424
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,851
- your fucking sneakers.
- No, no! Whoa, whoa!

425
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:43,720
Whoa, holy shit, man. What the fuck?

426
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,140
This is some kind of, like,
ghetto batcave, huh?

427
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:51,099
Yeah. Told you. This sneaker-head shit
is a moneymaker.

428
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,184
- Yeah?
- You got a computer and a connection,

429
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,939
- you can sell anything.
- Really?

430
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,112
Don't touch any of my shit, though.

431
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,609
All right, man. Christ.

432
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,486
All right, check this out.

433
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,661
Ebay for dope fiends.
They even got reviews and shit.

434
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:13,673
Oh, shit.

435
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,041
So what do you do? You just...

436
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,549
You buy it on here and then what?

437
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,999
What do you mean, "and then what?"

438
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,174
What, it just arrives
at your fucking door?

439
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:28,352
Yeah, yo. People been fucking
with the dark web for a minute now.

440
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,624
Light shit, you know what I'm saying?

441
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,685
Niggas was using PayPal,
western union, dumb shit.

442
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,312
But you cyber pigs was on to that.

443
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,395
The genius of this, they using bitcoin.

444
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,945
Fucking genius shit.

445
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:41,861
What's bitcoin?

446
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,201
It's cryptocurrency, yo.

447
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,903
- Okay.
- It's the future of money.

448
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,517
I'm sayin',
a few niggas know about it now,

449
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,999
but once people get hip to this shit,
it's gonna be in every suburb in America.

450
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,254
The fuck do you know all this shit, man?

451
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,500
Baltimore public library.

452
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,837
Fuck.

453
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,169
Fuck is so funny, yo?
You wanna buy some drugs or not?

454
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,629
I do wanna buy some drugs, so...

455
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:06,841
Don't touch my shit, all right?
Don't touch my shit.

456
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,051
Come on, dude, lighten up, so...

457
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,682
Uh-huh. What you want?

458
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,709
I don't know.
I think we should start with...

459
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,099
Anything you want.
You want some mushrooms?

460
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,397
You look like someone who does mushrooms.

461
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,867
You know,
you are a walking cliché, bow-den.

462
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,913
White man buying dope
from a nigga in the hood.

463
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,875
Yeah, well,
that's bowden, motherfucker.

464
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,827
Bowden, bow-den, same shit, man.

465
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:36,958
- Bowden.
- All right.

466
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,581
Yo, let me ask you a question.

467
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,008
- Shoot.
- Who out there slinging right now?

468
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,128
Some jumpy-ass rabbit motherfucker

469
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,465
with the cornrows
and the buck teeth there.

470
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,676
- Look at him.
- Yeah. You racist as shit.

471
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:53,103
Yeah, but am I fucking wrong?

472
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,976
Nah, today you right as rain.

473
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,980
But tomorrow, look over there, see that?

474
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,277
See that nigga right there?

475
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,822
- Hmm.
- Game is changing, feel me?

476
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,861
Do you have my shit?

477
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,985
Yeah.

478
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,996
- Bam.
- No shit.

479
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,665
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

480
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,043
Welcome to the future, baby.

481
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,043
Let me see your phone.

482
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:23,988
- Your phone.
- Fuck you want with my phone?

483
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,877
Let me see your phone.

484
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,008
There, have at it.

485
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,636
All right. Let me see your ID.

486
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:34,679
- Why?
- Let me see your ID. Shit.

487
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,265
Old-ass wallet.

488
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,648
- What are you doing?
- Can you just relax for a second?

489
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,688
All right.

490
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:49,068
Congratulations, you now own
a bitcoin wallet.

491
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,995
Next time you want some dope,
have uncle Sam send it, all right?

492
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,707
Now that's your solid,
don't call me no fucking more.

493
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,459
Get your own fucking...

494
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,754
Jj

495
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,687
No, I mean, we're talking
about a multi-jurisdiction.

496
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,712
- The situation that, um...
- Shields, you need to see this.

497
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,088
- But what I'm saying is that, if...
- Boss.

498
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,272
Hold on, one moment.

499
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,355
No, not now, Rick, stop. Go on.

500
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,284
Yeah, right, in a normal situation
there's, uh, you know,

501
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,612
for every man in the forces,
there's a manager.

502
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:36,244
So what I'm saying here
is that we take the...

503
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,621
I mean, we could, yeah, but it...

504
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,542
I've decided to keep a journal
about my experience running the site.

505
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:47,046
I imagine that someday
I may have a story written about my life

506
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:50,049
and it would be a good idea
to keep a detailed account of it.

507
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,970
I'm creating
a year of prosperity and power

508
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,894
beyond what I have
ever experienced before.

509
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,557
Silk road is going to become a phenomenon.

510
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:06,065
And at least one person will tell me
about it unknowing that I was its creator.

511
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:16,993
Oh, shit.
These beers fair game? Ross?

512
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:21,293
Earth to Ross. Hello,
Mr. rossington. Okay.

513
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,380
That's a yes.

514
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,338
Yo, check this out.

515
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:30,010
- Great name, nice camel.
- Keep reading.

516
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,757
Okay, indicas, sour diesel 13
and grape ape.

517
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,135
Acid, microdot or blotter.

518
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,688
Mdma, ecstasy,
basically the same thing, and 'shrooms.

519
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,899
Yeah, dude, you're, uh, so getting busted.

520
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,773
Nope. Bitcoin plus Tor. Untraceable.

521
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,946
You're insane.
Can you please tell him he's insane?

522
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,398
You're insane.

523
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,029
Also, uh, just a thought, friend.

524
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:57,621
How's anyone supposed to find this?
You can't advertise it, Ross.

525
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:00,164
I've been posing as a user
and touting it on the forums.

526
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,035
The forums?

527
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,995
What? The chat rooms...

528
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,206
You're too good for chat rooms,
too good for forums?

529
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,791
No, man, chat rooms
are, uh, cute, they're nice.

530
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:13,879
But you're gonna want more exposure than,
you know, some 4chan fuckheads.

531
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,756
Oh, you should call
my friend over at gawker.

532
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,059
You have a friend at gawker?

533
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:22,980
Yeah, I met him
at south by last year. Don't ask.

534
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,727
Lot of questions there, but...

535
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,901
Okay, well, he's not just gonna
pick up an anonymous call

536
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,320
at like, what, 10 o'clock at night?

537
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,864
Uh, that's exactly what he's gonna do,
he's a reporter.

538
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,907
It's a story.

539
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:38,237
Don't do it. Ross,
I'm begging you, don't do it.

540
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,364
Ross, don't do it.

541
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,666
Yeah. Give me his number.

542
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,413
- No.
- Yeah.

543
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,454
♪67.

544
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:48,734
- Of course.
- This is fucking dumb.

545
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,091
- I wasn't born yesterday.
- You're literally going straight to...

546
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,669
It's your idea, bro.

547
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,345
Gawker.

548
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,431
- Adrian? Uh...
- Who's this?

549
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,399
You don't know me,
but I have your next story.

550
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,318
Thirty seconds.

551
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,361
Making small talk
with your pot dealer sucks.

552
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,280
Buying cocaine can get you shot.

553
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:17,234
But what if you could buy drugs online
like socks or light bulbs?

554
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:20,412
Now you can with an online website
called silk road.

555
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:24,117
- Did you coach him on this?
- Who am I talking with?

556
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,293
Call me Mark.

557
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,995
No last name, but you can quote me.

558
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,924
- And you created it?
- No, but I ordered ten hits of acid

559
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,595
delivered to my doorstep
by the us postal service.

560
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,342
And what did that feel like?

561
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,970
Well, to tell you the truth, Adrian...

562
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,682
It kind of felt like the future.

563
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:48,482
Last question.

564
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,230
Anything you can't get on silk road?

565
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,399
Nothing to harm or defraud,

566
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,074
like kiddie porn or stolen credit cards.

567
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,152
- So no weapons-grade plutonium?
- Or murder for hire.

568
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,700
Is there anything you'd like to add?

569
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:05,543
Yes.

570
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,669
Stop funding the state
with your tax dollars

571
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:13,294
and direct your productive energies
towards the black markets.

572
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,709
- Fuck you.
- Whoo!

573
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,262
- Holy shit.
- That felt good, man.

574
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,431
- You know what that felt like?
- Huh?

575
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,349
The future. You know.

576
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,373
I just felt it right in my bones,
right there, the future.

577
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,137
Go fuck yourself. Don't be jealous.

578
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,072
It's right there,
it's right ahead of us.

579
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,614
Oh, hey, peanut!

580
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:42,240
What are you doing here? Huh?
What are you doing here?

581
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,367
Hey. We were in the neighborhood.
Thought we could stop by and say hey.

582
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,824
- Is that right? This for me?
- Mm-hmm.

583
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,830
Figured you could use the company.

584
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,912
Yeah, another Cobb salad
with these dipshits,

585
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,127
- I swear to god I'll eat a bullet.
- Language, daddy.

586
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,211
Oh, "language, daddy." Is that right?

587
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:57,884
Nineteen years you've been on this job,

588
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,407
this is the first time
I've been in your office.

589
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,264
Yeah, the last one wasn't exactly
a daycare, was it?

590
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,432
Neither was Max's taphouse.

591
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,018
Tell you what, why don't we
get outta here, huh?

592
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,750
- Why don't we go somewhere special?
- Get some ice cream.

593
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,187
Ice cream for lunch?
No, no, no, no, no.

594
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,006
She's gonna have ice cream for lunch,
come on, let's go.

595
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,395
I'm having ice cream for lunch?

596
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,843
- Yeah, you are, only if you behave.
- Yeah, we'll see about that.

597
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,028
- You watch that mouth, girl.
- Come on, let's go.

598
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,320
Look at that.
What do you think? Huh?

599
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,906
Edie, look, they got nurse sharks.
Go check 'em out.

600
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,124
Oh, my god. Go on, honey.

601
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:32,828
I think they're sleeping.

602
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,339
You checking up on me?

603
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:39,759
Yeah, I am. You okay with that?

604
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:44,347
Oh, my gosh. Babe, look. Check it out.

605
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,095
Did you go to the school?

606
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:49,804
I did. Forest hills, babe, it's amazing.

607
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,555
Classes are all small,

608
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:56,064
and the teachers all specialize
in overcoming learning challenges.

609
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,237
- Okay.
- It's... it's great.

610
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,610
Hey, baby, honey, don't tap on the glass.

611
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,363
She saw a little boy her age
who had built a robot.

612
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,696
- A walking, talking robot. It was...
- How much?

613
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,144
Did they say? Did you talk about it?

614
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,704
- Yeah.
- How much?

615
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,419
- Forty.
- Fuck.

616
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,542
I told them you were in law enforcement
and that I am a nurse,

617
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:22,799
and they have scholarships
and she's eligible for those.

618
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,504
So we're gonna go for it.

619
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,464
- They said that?
- Yeah.

620
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,890
- Really?
- Yeah.

621
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,269
Hey, come on, look at her.
Look at that little...

622
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,894
I mean, how do they not give her
a full scholarship, huh?

623
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,645
Mm.

624
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,101
- Huh?
- Yeah.

625
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,902
And you think
this is the way to go, huh?

626
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:41,987
This is good for her.

627
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,692
I need you to get on board, okay?

628
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,246
You with us?

629
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,408
When am I not with you, huh?

630
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:56,457
Hmm?

631
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,626
Jj

632
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,219
It'll never go in. Yeah!

633
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,139
You suck. Doesn't he suck? He sucks.

634
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,436
No, you're jealous.

635
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:14,923
Constantly.

636
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,516
Well, your phone is blowing up.

637
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,521
Are you sure you don't want
to check your phone?

638
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,215
- Don't you want to check your phone?
- Don't sabotage.

639
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,604
- I know you do.
- Don't sabotage.

640
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:26,362
Wait, no, seriously, dude,
you have like 50 unread messages.

641
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:30,445
What the hell?

642
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,826
This says a 101.

643
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,704
You get hacked or something?

644
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,313
Three hundred and thirteen new messages.

645
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,547
- From who?
- I don't know. I...

646
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,530
I had everything from silk road
forwarded to my gmail.

647
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:45,714
Holy shit.

648
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,466
The gawker article posted.

649
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,344
He wrote what you said, word for word.

650
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,097
Holy shit.

651
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,930
One thousand one hundred and fifty-four.

652
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,981
That's gonna crash your site, man.

653
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,194
Shit, you're right.

654
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,114
Okay, we gotta go. Finish your beer.

655
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,238
No, actually, fuck your beer.
We gotta go.

656
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,140
- No, we got a full fucking pitcher, Ross.
- No, we got to go.

657
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,325
- We can't just...
- Hold on, I got this.

658
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:18,126
Grab your shit. Just leave...
Leave the chip. Come on.

659
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,581
Jj

660
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,381
Bounced the local hosting?

661
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,085
Outsourced it
to a data center in Iceland.

662
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,549
Get fucked, NSA.

663
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,843
NSA?

664
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,553
I just made 75 grand in bitcoin
in the last 90 minutes, babe.

665
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,598
Sooner or later
someone's gonna come knocking.

666
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:47,564
But now, they can't trace my ip address.

667
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:52,153
Ross, that's $833 a minute.

668
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,158
Go the other way.

669
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:02,622
Holy shit, 1.2 million a day.

670
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,591
Fuck you.

671
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,676
Jj

672
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:21,932
Neighbors, there is something
interesting going on right now.

673
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:27,146
What if I were to tell you there's a drug
superstore on the Internet right now?

674
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,362
To all the new faces, welcome.

675
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,282
Our basic rules are to treat others
as you wish to be treated,

676
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:39,457
and don't do anything
to hurt or scam anyone else.

677
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,944
Something special came in the mail.

678
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,373
It looks and feels
exactly like ebay, Amazon,

679
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,584
whatever other online purchasing site
you're familiar with.

680
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,631
Silk road is already making
an impact on the war on drugs

681
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:58,935
by expanding people's access
to controlled substances.

682
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,559
Every transaction that takes place

683
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,268
outside the nexus
of state control is a victory.

684
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,946
So there are literally hundreds
of victories here each week,

685
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:12,900
and each one weakens the state.

686
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,736
To learn more
about libertarianism, philosophy

687
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,822
or just to make friends,
check out the forums.

688
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,203
Oh, and please,
contribute to the community

689
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:24,661
by reviewing your sellers,
buyers and products.

690
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,042
And you're not paranoid
about using the mail?

691
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:31,217
No. They, like, vacuum seal it
so the dogs can't even smell it.

692
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,966
Like, seriously,
they've thought of everything.

693
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,423
- Whoa.
- Yeah. Game changer.

694
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,677
Who runs it?

695
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:41,102
I don't know,
but the guy's pretty genius.

696
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:48,143
- Genius.
- Don't get ahead of yourself.

697
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,354
Their words.

698
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,764
Anybody else
from your outfit coming today?

699
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,574
Nope, they save
all the good stuff for me.

700
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:05,494
Okay. Us postal service interdicts
narcotics by two primary means.

701
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:09,206
One is drug dogs, effective for large
shipments of controlled substances,

702
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,040
typically a kilo or more.

703
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,501
The other is random x-rays.

704
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,302
This is your ounce or less crew.

705
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,221
This latter category,

706
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,640
we've noticed a 300% increase
in the past three months.

707
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,809
Lot of little stuff adds up
to the big stuff, right?

708
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:23,814
Theoretically.

709
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,729
So what do you think's driving the spike?

710
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,169
I don't know, it's all small-time,

711
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,060
so they haven't given us
the resources to figure it out yet.

712
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,395
Well, do they have anything in common?

713
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,980
Actually, yes.

714
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,513
Everything they've seized out of Utah
has that stamped on it.

715
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:38,537
No shit.

716
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,612
Jj

717
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,356
Yo, rayford, man, come on.
It's bowden. Open the fuck up.

718
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,415
Motherfucker.

719
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,632
Oh, fuck.

720
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,050
Fuck that nigga right there.

721
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,102
Fuck.

722
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:48,020
You open this motherfucking door,

723
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,627
you motherfucking piece of fuck!

724
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,903
Fucking game, dude, huh?
You think this is fucking funny?

725
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,356
Come on, why don't you ease it?

726
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:01,534
Goddamn! Fuck, dude,
it smells dank in here.

727
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:03,849
You know, I'm gonna have you note that
that came anonymous...

728
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:06,060
Oh, what, you cooking up a chicken
with this oregano? Hmm.

729
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,996
No, that's from a customer.
I didn't pay for that. That's...

730
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:12,329
Yeah, I don't give a fuck
about your fucking chicken.

731
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,549
What else can you tell me about this cat
that sold you the 'shrooms?

732
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:21,880
- Uh, goes by the name of chronic pain.
- Yeah, and what else? Come on.

733
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,886
- That's it.
- Come on, dude, help me out.

734
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,889
I got an envelope postmarked Utah.
I got no return address.

735
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,140
Utah's a big-ass state.

736
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:33,141
What else can you tell me about him?
Something? Chronic pain?

737
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:36,103
Well, hold on.
What makes you think it's a him?

738
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:39,109
You ever seen this movie
called cocaine cowboys?

739
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,610
It was a documentary.

740
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:44,114
And the baddest motherfucker in that
was a bitch named the black widow.

741
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:46,912
She was drilling holes in motherfuckers...

742
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,436
What the fuck has this got to do
with what I'm asking you about?

743
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,327
I'm just saying. A nigga can be whoever
they want on the Internet.

744
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,088
Whoever they want.

745
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,166
Jj

746
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,663
You know what people do with cats?

747
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,973
They just let them
live in their fucking house.

748
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,476
They don't even
actually interact, like, ever.

749
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:17,102
They're like, "oh, look at all my cats.
I keep them alive."

750
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,856
You and I, we, like, actually hang out.

751
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,030
Imagine a baby,

752
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:28,409
but it's tall, it's cute.

753
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:33,451
But it's intimidating,
it is the size of a basketball hoop

754
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:36,333
and it's asking for its pacifier.

755
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:42,385
And it could crush you, but it's asking
for a cracker or something.

756
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,384
You're the man now, dawg.

757
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:50,226
What was the movie

758
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:53,305
where James Bond was the guy
with the blind kid?

759
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,889
That was a good movie.

760
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,073
- Why don't you come to bed?
- Listen to this.

761
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,993
"Fish scale Colombian cocaine.

762
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:20,624
Has a nice sheen and provides a rush
of euphoria and confidence."

763
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:22,879
Now this one.

764
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:29,053
"Crystal mdma. Has a lovely fizz
and a wisp of smoke."

765
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,220
- You've got issues.
- I think I just solved them.

766
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,606
This guy is a one-man fan club.

767
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:41,193
- That's not what I meant.
- You're getting obsessive.

768
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,067
I think you mean obsessed.
You know what I meant.

769
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,320
I'll be in bed.

770
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:57,252
Oh, that's not where we're going
with our teeth, baby.

771
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,108
We're not going down there,

772
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,132
going up here.

773
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,299
Oh, hold up.

774
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:07,845
"Your work has not gone unnoticed.
Wanna offer you a job."

775
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,172
What?

776
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,305
Uh, okay.

777
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:17,347
What do I have to do?

778
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,557
What? You gotta get up.

779
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:22,143
This is getting interesting.
You're gonna miss this, come here.

780
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,396
"Review products.
Manage orders. Get rich."

781
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,901
"Get rich"?

782
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,866
I'm in, brother.

783
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:35,531
"Send scan of your ID"?

784
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,867
Yeah, what do you think of that?
What should we tell him?

785
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,749
To kiss our dimply ass?

786
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:47,044
"Why do you need my ID
when I don't know who you are?"

787
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,718
Nice try, jokester.

788
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:57,808
Oh! Underboss, bitches!

789
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,141
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

790
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,395
Yes.

791
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:07,105
I'm just gonna roll the die

792
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,735
and hope I don't die.

793
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:14,575
You support this, right?
You wanna be an underboss, right?

794
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:18,374
You don't wanna be a fucking ferret
your whole life.

795
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,003
I need a name. I need a name.
I need a name.

796
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,632
"Then David came to nob..."

797
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,559
Nob it is for me.

798
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:41,980
Daddy?

799
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,818
Oh, hey, peanut,
what are you doing up? Huh?

800
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:48,021
Where's mom?

801
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:50,648
Asleep on the couch.

802
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:52,825
Oh. She must be fucking drunk.

803
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:54,909
You wanna help me?

804
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,787
Take a picture of me? Do that?

805
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,205
Right, there we go, just...

806
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,958
Up here, honey. Up here, yeah?

807
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,088
Smile, dada.

808
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,041
No, no smile, I'm a bad guy.

809
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,989
Just pretending to be a bad guy,
but I'm a bad guy.

810
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,504
Bad guys wear their hoodies up.

811
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,849
You got a point. All right.

812
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,268
Well spotted, honey. How's that?

813
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:25,900
- Got it.
- Got it, yes, you did. Bingo.

814
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,227
Off you go, okay?
Thanks for helping.

815
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,404
Little things, dada, make you believe.

816
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:33,824
Little things. Yeah, well,
one more little thing, okay? Honey?

817
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,868
This is between you and me, okay?
Don't tell mom.

818
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:44,747
Up you go.

819
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,960
Fuck. Okay.

820
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:54,129
Jj

821
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,068
- Yo.
- Yeah, dude, it's me.

822
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,987
Stop calling me all the time, man.

823
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:15,407
How do I get the picture from the camera
to the fucking computer, man?

824
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,485
Jj

825
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:50,147
Oh, here we go. We're up.

826
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,648
Thanks.

827
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:55,943
Yeah.

828
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,125
Tonight our call-6 investigators
dig into what's known as the dark net.

829
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,871
It's been called ebay for illegal drugs.

830
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,251
A network of relatively hidden websites

831
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:15,335
where users can buy everything
from ecstasy to opium.

832
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,717
The silk road website
is a particular headache for authorities.

833
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,469
The government says
hundreds of thousands of users

834
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,768
use the impossible-to-trace website
which sells drugs.

835
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,642
We're talking about
cocaine, LSD, ecstasy.

836
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,098
You hame it and it's here.

837
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:32,777
Someone that is wanting to sell illegal
drugs can use this to come in contact

838
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,623
with someone that wants
to buy illegal drugs.

839
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,274
What do you think?

840
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,116
Oh, my god, Ross, this is really serious.

841
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,953
An underground website
used to sell illegal drugs

842
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,410
is the new target for New York senator
Charles schumer.

843
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:52,747
He's asked federal authorities
to shut down and investigate the site.

844
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:55,583
It's known as silk road.

845
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:57,669
This website is nothing more

846
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:01,176
than an all-you-can-order
buffet of contraband

847
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:03,633
that needs to be shut down immediately.

848
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,727
Are you scared?

849
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:10,810
Yeah.

850
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:15,193
Yeah.

851
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:18,760
Hey, you got a call
from the FBI.

852
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,524
Putting together
an inter-agency task force

853
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,530
- on some online dope bazaar.
- What, silk road?

854
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,765
- Yeah.
- No, we're already on it.

855
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,120
Who's running point?

856
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,539
A guy called tarbell.
Sounds like a real gunner.

857
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,834
He's just looking for a token narc
to qualify for ocdetf funding.

858
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,252
You got somebody we can spare?

859
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,295
No fucking way, I got my a-team on this.

860
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:36,063
FBI'll just steal our work
claiming credit.

861
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,135
Shields, I can't say no

862
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,380
to an inter-departmental
request, okay?

863
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,678
Look, personally, I don't give
a fuck who you send,

864
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,405
long as they got a badge and a heartbeat.

865
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:47,013
Fuck.

866
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,646
Jesus fucking Christ.

867
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,608
Oh, Jesus.

868
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,402
- Bowden?
- Yeah.

869
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:02,199
Oh, hang on. What?

870
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:06,787
- Are you familiar with silk road?
- Yeah.

871
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:08,705
- Really?
- Yeah.

872
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,829
What the fuck? It's a website.
They sell dope and shit on the net.

873
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:16,205
Perfect. The FBI's putting together
a task force.

874
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,461
There's a briefing
at the federal building at 1100.

875
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,964
Report to agent tarbell. You'll love him.

876
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:23,546
- Okay. Hey, shields?
- Yep?

877
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,848
Is there any way to track
dope busts in the mail?

878
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,220
You know, small shit, ounce or less.

879
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,678
Yeah, I'll have sirkis set up a geofence.

880
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:33,668
They'll notify you whenever the local
postal interdiction police gets a pop.

881
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,729
- Geofence? Good.
- Yeah.

882
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,230
Why?

883
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:39,983
No reason, you know.

884
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:43,441
I might have an idea to crack
this silk road shit wide open.

885
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,196
- Rick?
- Yeah.

886
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,890
I've got a next-level team on this, okay?

887
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,314
And I don't need some old-school street
crap buggering it up.

888
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:54,001
Report to the task force, keep your trap
shut, and don't make us look stupid.

889
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:02,092
As the NSA puts it,
with 2.5 million daily users,

890
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:07,765
Tor's the king of high-security,
low-latency Internet anonymity.

891
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,933
You're aware, boss,
that given the volume of users,

892
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,932
the odds of finding a single ip address
are almost impossible?

893
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,354
I was hoping you'd say that, Kim.

894
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,026
What you got there
is five grams of cupronickel.

895
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:28,032
75% copper, 25% nickel.
Worth five American cents.

896
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,612
What the hell happened to it?

897
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:33,416
I got this brother-in-law in west Texas,
married to my kid sister.

898
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:35,743
Seven kids between them.

899
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,956
Now I'm not saying for certain,
there's an extra chromosome involved,

900
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,291
but this guy is not gonna win
any MacArthur grants.

901
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:43,655
Do you know what I'm saying?

902
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,843
And until last Tuesday, he might have been
the unluckiest man in America.

903
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,049
Well, what happened Tuesday?

904
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:56,056
He got hit by lightning...
For a second time.

905
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,141
- Did it kill him?
- No.

906
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:02,611
He had that nickel in his pocket, though.

907
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,232
The electrical current
burned a hole in his dungarees,

908
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:09,864
seared through his testicular wall
and cauterized his vas deferens.

909
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:15,116
God's own vasectomy.

910
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,919
The odds of that happening?
One in 25 million.

911
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:20,746
My point being, Kim...

912
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,752
Nothing's impossible.

913
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,919
Fantastic. I see the DEA sent
its best and its brightest.

914
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:29,175
Uh, welcome to the task force,
Mr. flintstone?

915
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,507
No, bowden, Rick bowden, DEA.
Hey, guys.

916
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,638
Chris tarbell, FBI. Have a seat, please.

917
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:36,049
Sorry, I'm late, man, I just got
fucking caught up in here.

918
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,097
Sure you did. Okay.

919
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,690
Are we working any human sources?

920
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:41,984
- No.
- No?

921
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,606
Sorry, what was that?

922
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,359
Did you... did you need something there?

923
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,783
No. I just, uh, wondered
if we're working any human sources?

924
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:52,820
Negative.

925
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:54,121
Well, you mean not yet, huh?

926
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,617
No, I mean, I'm just not really
into wasting resources, sport.

927
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:02,455
We're not tailing guys here.
We're hunting ip addresses.

928
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:09,386
I mean, fuck, somebody somewhere's
touching the keyboards, right?

929
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:11,073
Wait a minute, are you gonna crack this?

930
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:14,008
You can just crack it the old-fashioned
way, agent bowden?

931
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,558
Maybe.

932
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:19,855
That's fantastic. I'll tell you what,
when you snatch him up, send me a fax.

933
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,232
Jj

934
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,451
Ross.

935
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:05,620
Ross, we need to have a conversation.

936
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:07,454
Just one sec.

937
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,335
Pay attention to me.

938
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,213
- I am.
- Look, this is on the silk road homepage.

939
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:18,970
Crack, crystal meth. You're making money
off of drug addicts and poor people.

940
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:20,926
Julia, look,

941
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:24,434
the average silk road user
is college educated,

942
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:27,015
has a laptop
and has access to broadband.

943
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,772
More than that, there are seller reviews.

944
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:33,355
Baby, buying drugs off of my site is safer
than buying 'em on the street.

945
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,815
Give me a break, Ross.

946
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,616
You might not understand this.

947
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:40,537
This is my community and I care about it.

948
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:50,039
Wait.

949
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,463
Jj

950
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,605
Zoom right here.

951
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,734
Third one this week.

952
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,157
It's hardly worth the paperwork
for a little marijuana.

953
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,089
I guess we gotta
write it up though.

954
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:33,708
Fucking meth? Jesus Christ.

955
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:46,895
Come on, I saw you, you fucking bitch.

956
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:01,027
Jj

957
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,630
Hey. Where you been?

958
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,673
Out.

959
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,724
Hey.

960
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,308
I'm sorry.

961
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:33,768
Sorry that I've been distant...

962
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:38,989
And I've been a little obsessed.
You're right.

963
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,447
And obsessive. Both are correct, actually.

964
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:48,866
You're such a dick.

965
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,386
I got something else to tell you.

966
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,472
What?

967
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:11,476
I got a new name... for my admin.

968
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,683
The dread pirate Roberts.

969
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,773
Princess bride. You fucking kidding me?

970
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:23,786
No.

971
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:28,284
Julia, it's brilliant. Look, that way,
I can pass it along to somebody else.

972
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,240
This thing is gonna outlive all of us.

973
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:34,661
This isn't a movie, Ross.
I'm gonna go to bed.

974
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,337
J as you wish. J

975
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:51,432
Where have you been?

976
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:54,397
Edie waited up.

977
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:57,734
Yeah, I was at work. I was working.

978
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,527
What's going on here, huh?
Are you drunk?

979
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:02,272
- Are you?
- Yeah. No, I'm...

980
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,824
No, I'm fucking working,
I said. Huh?

981
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:05,991
Hmm.

982
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,350
I'm hunting, baby. I'm hunting big game.

983
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:13,663
I mean, seriously, Sandy.
Like kingpin shit.

984
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,870
Yeah, I mean, this guy's gotta be...
You know, he's got these...

985
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:19,627
He's like the first millennial gangster.

986
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:21,424
Yeah, it's the future of drug trafficking,

987
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,968
I'm telling ya.
I ain't seen nothing like it.

988
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,450
All these other young bucks, they think
I'm some kind of old fucking dinosaur.

989
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,055
They're doing their digital downloads.

990
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,412
But I'm the one
with these fucking hooks in.

991
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:31,677
I'm the one who's gonna bring
this fucking prick down.

992
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:36,769
This is exactly how you sounded
before Puerto Rico.

993
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,397
No, it's not how it was like
in Puerto Rico.

994
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:41,327
- It's different?
- Yeah, completely different.

995
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,364
- Is it?
- Yeah.

996
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:44,861
Is it, Rick? Really?
What's going on in Utah?

997
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,068
What the... what?

998
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:49,653
- What?
- Yeah. What?

999
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:52,034
I get the same high-purchase alerts
you do, okay?

1000
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:55,037
Tell me what the fuck is going on in Utah.

1001
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,338
Cyber conference. Yeah.

1002
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,211
- It's a cyber conference? Okay.
- Yeah.

1003
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:03,633
- And you're paying for it?
- No.

1004
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,302
They haven't requisitioned the money yet.
They'll pay me back.

1005
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:11,329
You know, the thing
about being married to a narc

1006
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:13,810
is that you never know
when they're lying to you.

1007
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:19,045
Let's go. Engage. Engage.

1008
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:21,060
Jj

1009
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,945
"weird al" yankovic.

1010
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:29,492
Let's go.

1011
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:49,763
Get under there! Get the fucking...

1012
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,286
- Hands where I can see them!
- Don't fucking move!

1013
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,722
Down now! Down on the fucking ground!

1014
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:56,474
What? You fucking deaf? Huh?

1015
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,395
- I can help.
- You what? Huh?

1016
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,919
I can tell you anything you want to know.

1017
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:00,943
Huh? Yeah?

1018
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,268
Thought he was gonna win
the fucking penalty shoot, yeah?

1019
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:05,383
Well, no, you don't fucking know.
What do you got here?

1020
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:08,114
- What is this? Is this your Fanny pack?
- Yeah.

1021
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:11,568
A fucking Fanny pack? Dude,
your mother know about this? Huh?

1022
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:15,572
Huh?

1023
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:17,584
Whoa!

1024
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,451
- Yeah!
- It's... I... it's for my taxes.

1025
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,128
Fat, fucking roll, dude.

1026
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,855
I don't like bank... I don't trust banks.

1027
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:26,541
Fucking hook this prick up
and voucher this.

1028
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,802
Clean your fucking ears out.
What did I say?

1029
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,532
I said go take a sketch of the premises
and then report back to me.

1030
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:37,556
You boys got a light?

1031
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:47,300
Where the fuck do they find these guys?
I swear to god.

1032
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,485
Well, probably a fucking vegetarian.

1033
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,280
You know, I swear to fucking god, dude.

1034
01:03:57,876 --> 01:03:59,457
This whole job's changed.

1035
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,788
Well, we certainly can't get shit done
the way we used to.

1036
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:05,247
Fucking a.

1037
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:13,680
Don't know about you, but I don't have
the fucking Patience for this bullshit.

1038
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:16,304
Filling out the paperwork and that.
You know what I'm saying?

1039
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:19,140
No. What are you saying?

1040
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,141
I'm saying I can take it from here
if you want.

1041
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,315
Is it gonna come back on me?

1042
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:26,977
Do I look like a vegetarian?

1043
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:31,068
Jj

1044
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,056
Where the fuck are you, Curtis?

1045
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:10,020
- Hey.
- Hey.

1046
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:12,857
- Have you eaten anything?
- I'm fine.

1047
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,952
- You know, I'm starting to get a little...
- Don't!

1048
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,705
I'm really sorry. I...

1049
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:29,873
Look, I am running a $50 million company,
operating in 17 different countries

1050
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:33,085
with exactly one employee who just dropped
off the face of the earth.

1051
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,591
It's just a website, Ross!

1052
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,601
It's the thing.

1053
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:45,764
And you would know that,
except you've never done anything.

1054
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:56,190
I'm gonna go for a run.

1055
01:05:57,203 --> 01:06:00,195
And when I come back, I want you
and all your shit out of here.

1056
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,746
You hear me?

1057
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:15,002
Please, sir,
this guy we're dealing with,

1058
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:20,341
he's got unlimited resources
and he's unpredictable...

1059
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:22,847
I'm gonna break your fucking nose,
I'm gonna do it.

1060
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:25,428
He's... I can tell you
whatever the fuck you...

1061
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:28,060
I'll write a term paper, for fuck's sake!

1062
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:29,766
- The money.
- The money.

1063
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:32,102
I know all about how the money works.

1064
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:33,812
- S07?
- Okay.

1065
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:36,193
There's bitcoin.
Are you familiar with bitcoin?

1066
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:37,945
Bitcoin?

1067
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:40,322
- Don't be a fucking cunt, Curtis.
- Oh, fuck!

1068
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,200
Don't be a cunt, Curtis.
Don't be a fucking cunt, dude.

1069
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,532
- Don't be a fucking cunt, okay?
- Okay, no cunt.

1070
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:46,992
You fat fucking cunt!

1071
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:51,170
- Can't fucking...
- So, you know bitcoin.

1072
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:57,048
And there's some people
use bitcoin to transfer money.

1073
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:59,003
They make transactions.

1074
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:02,807
Those transactions on silk road
get put into an escrow account

1075
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:06,762
and then stays there until both parties
have signed off.

1076
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,596
So nobody gets ripped off.

1077
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,023
That, and there's a ratings-based system.

1078
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,600
Yeah.

1079
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:17,405
The customer service and dependability,
reliability, it's all a big part of it.

1080
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:20,359
Skip the corporate bullshit, okay?
You're no global conglomerate, so...

1081
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:26,790
See, we are, though.
We are a global enterprise.

1082
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:29,500
And it's growing.

1083
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:33,455
Not growing by the week or the month,
it's growing by the hour.

1084
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,963
And at the crest of it
is fucking dpr and he's...

1085
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,509
He's a visionary.

1086
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,054
No shit.

1087
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:44,307
And what are you? An apostle?

1088
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,472
In pink fucking socks and crocs, dude?

1089
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:50,972
I'm the one...

1090
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,854
I may look like a fucking idiot to you,

1091
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:56,561
but I am the one who has access
to the escrow account.

1092
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:01,236
Fucking holding out on me, dude.

1093
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,406
- Okay.
- No, I'll tell you anything.

1094
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:05,975
You're gonna prove it
is what you're gonna do.

1095
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,489
I'll prove anything. How?

1096
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,580
Wire me the bitcoin.

1097
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:17,753
That's... that's not how it...

1098
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:19,405
That is how it works,
but it's not how it works.

1099
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,215
Well, what are you gonna do with the...

1100
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:24,969
Gonna Mark it exhibit a
in the case against your boss.

1101
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,059
On.

1102
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:30,645
Okay. I appreciate
what you're doing, but this is...

1103
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:35,517
It's like $200,000 or something
in the account.

1104
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:37,477
He could kill me for that type of money.

1105
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,735
Really?

1106
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,201
What?

1107
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:48,280
Jj

1108
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:52,662
What the fuck?

1109
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:09,099
What the fuck are you doing
with my money, Curtis?

1110
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,390
Got you, you son of a bitch.

1111
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:24,574
Hey, Max! Your parents still in Aspen?

1112
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,242
- Holy shit!
- Hey, man.

1113
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:28,615
The prodigal son returns.

1114
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,947
Yeah. Yes, it has been a while.

1115
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:33,249
Yup, it's been six weeks, dude.

1116
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:39,463
Hey, uh, look, I got a favor to ask you.

1117
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:43,468
If I give you someone's ID, can you
look up if they've been arrested or not?

1118
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,801
Why do you always come to me
with this shit, Ross?

1119
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,391
'Cause you're my best friend.

1120
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:57,815
What's their name?

1121
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:02,066
Uh, Curtis Clark green.

1122
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:05,152
Out of Spanish fork, Utah.

1123
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:12,823
You, uh... you having a party?

1124
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,203
If you'd read any of my texts
for the last six weeks,

1125
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:19,207
you'd know I'm moving
to New York. Surprise!

1126
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,135
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1127
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,385
Okay, that's weird.

1128
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,938
There's a report for his arrest
in Spanish fork, Utah,

1129
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:41,062
but, for some reason,
he was never charged.

1130
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:44,733
Weird-looking dude.

1131
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,148
Shit.

1132
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:56,074
Shit.

1133
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:00,086
You know, Julia warned you about this.

1134
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:02,084
- Fuck!
- We both did.

1135
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:20,440
"Got a problem in Utah.
Requires violence. Can you help?"

1136
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:24,394
Yes, we can.

1137
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:27,814
Uh...

1138
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:38,704
Hey, Julia.

1139
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,675
- Julia, look, just talk to me. Just talk!
- No!

1140
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:43,588
You're selling assault rifles
on your fucking site, Ross.

1141
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:49,093
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
It's the second amendment.

1142
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:53,385
When you said that you were
gonna change the world, I just...

1143
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,734
I wanted to believe
that it was for the better.

1144
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:59,137
- That's not fair.
- Okay.

1145
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:01,473
Hat's not... Julia, just listen.

1146
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,603
- Leave me alone, Ross.
- Listen to me.

1147
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:05,559
You heard her, asshole.

1148
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:06,861
Fuck off.

1149
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:14,694
That's nice. That's nice.

1150
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:22,001
Here. Thank you.

1151
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:23,419
Will you get me a shot?

1152
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:25,246
- Anything for you.
- Yeah.

1153
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,627
- Hey. You're too good for him anyway.
- Yeah.

1154
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:29,709
Jj

1155
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:18,303
Huh? Huh?

1156
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:24,347
- Fuck, bowden, you dumb fuck!
- Ah!

1157
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:26,353
Shit didn't even record.

1158
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:29,026
I did what you asked me to do.
I transferred the money!

1159
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:30,649
Why the fuck are you doing this?

1160
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:31,855
Because, my friend,

1161
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:36,363
if we pin some bullshit narcotics beef
on your fucking pirate boss,

1162
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:39,696
he's gonna post bail, walk free
and wanna chase up loose ends.

1163
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,388
And we know who that is.
On the other hand,

1164
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:45,543
if we get him on a conspiracy
to commit murder and kidnapping,

1165
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,566
well, that's 25 years to life.

1166
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,332
- What? What, murder?
- Nice, dude, here we go.

1167
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,487
- Why did you say murder?
- That's what I fucking said, dude.

1168
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,031
- No!
- Here, come on. Get the fuck up.

1169
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:41,508
Jj

1170
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,749
Damn, Curtis,

1171
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,799
your boss just caught a bullet train
to the fucking pen, dude.

1172
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:16,375
I ook at this.

1173
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,506
"Change the order from torture to kill."

1174
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:21,760
Fuck me, dude.

1175
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,722
What... what's that for?

1176
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:28,600
Huh? This is lunch. You hungry?

1177
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:31,644
Little piece of advice.

1178
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:35,228
The asphyxiation victim, the bile
looks exactly like chicken noodle soup.

1179
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:36,562
Open up.

1180
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:39,615
- What, should I just chew it?
- Open up, dude, open up.

1181
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:44,245
Here we go. You got it. Keep it in.

1182
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,247
Okay, don't choke on that. Lie down.

1183
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:49,495
Play dead.

1184
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:53,025
Clean that up. I'll get that fucking shit
out of there, there you go.

1185
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,415
Curtis, just give me a second here.

1186
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:57,834
All right.

1187
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:01,804
Come on, Curtis,
hold your breath, dude. Fuck!

1188
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:04,844
Close your eyes. All right.

1189
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:06,538
Oh, I love that dribbling out,

1190
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,098
it's nice.

1191
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:24,235
Hey, you need a ride?
Yeah, you need a ride?

1192
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:26,578
Ross!

1193
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,646
Jj

1194
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,411
Boom, motherfucker.

1195
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:26,933
Hey.

1196
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:29,008
FBI cybercrimes has
taken over the investigation.

1197
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:30,263
Good. Hold the fucking phone.

1198
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:31,581
I got the entire case right here.

1199
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:33,365
Now, whatever it is,
turn it over to tarbell.

1200
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:35,127
No, hear me out.
You're gonna wanna see this.

1201
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:36,461
- Trust me.
- No, I'm not. Not on the desk.

1202
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:37,975
- Not the desk.
- Come on, here.

1203
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,881
- Listen, Rick...
- I got the guy dead to rights.

1204
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,566
- Hang on.
- Rick!

1205
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,613
- It's just... hang on.
- I don't have the time.

1206
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:45,345
This department
doesn't have the money, okay,

1207
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:48,111
to teach you how law enforcement
works in the 21st century.

1208
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:50,742
So take your handwritten notes,
shove them in your brownwell

1209
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,243
and hand it over to tarbell.

1210
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:53,369
- Okay?
- Just... come on.

1211
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,792
- Trust me. Look at this. Just...
- I'll say it again.

1212
01:17:58,465 --> 01:17:59,750
Out!

1213
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:05,298
Hey, it's shields. In cybercrimes.

1214
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:08,138
Yeah, get me Johnson.

1215
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,800
All right, well, then get me hanson.

1216
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:13,970
Get me anybody here, okay?

1217
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:18,770
This is seven news.

1218
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:23,070
Tonight, 16-year-old Preston bridge
was celebrating after his school ball

1219
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:25,864
before he fell
from a second-floor balcony.

1220
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:28,658
His family still can't believe he's gone.

1221
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:32,580
I would just actually love to have seen
what he turned out to be.

1222
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:36,997
The synthetic LSD
that killed Preston was bought online.

1223
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:39,999
So potent, it made him think he could fly.

1224
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:43,548
He fell from a balcony and suffered
horrific head injuries.

1225
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:45,422
The federal government...

1226
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:50,139
- Hey.
- Hey.

1227
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:53,350
- Mom and dad called.
- Oh, yeah?

1228
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:55,077
Yeah, they were just asking how you were.

1229
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:56,929
What did you say?

1230
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:58,184
That I love having you here.

1231
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:00,978
It's great to be here.

1232
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:06,363
Why do you keep closing your laptop
every time I walk by?

1233
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:10,610
- I don't.
- Yeah, Ross, you do.

1234
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:17,163
I guess I don't even notice it. It's just
force of habit, you know, sensitive data.

1235
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:19,209
Wow, you look like dad when you lie.

1236
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:24,748
Hey, whatever's going on, you can tell me.

1237
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,089
Nothing's going on, cally.

1238
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:35,372
All right, fine, you know,
you wanna bullshit me, whatever.

1239
01:19:35,396 --> 01:19:39,639
Just, uh, don't lie to yourself, Ross,
'cause that's how you get lost.

1240
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:50,608
Jj

1241
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:04,564
Shh.

1242
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:10,229
What's the matter?
Is she having a nightmare?

1243
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:13,198
- She didn't get the scholarship.
- What?

1244
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:16,493
Why not? Didn't you
put the application in?

1245
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:19,993
I put the application in. You didn't
show up to the fucking interview.

1246
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:23,076
Shit. Fuck. Fuck, I forgot. Shit.

1247
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:25,669
I didn't make it.

1248
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:29,214
Oh, it's okay. It's okay, peanut. Hey.

1249
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:32,209
Can I go anyway?

1250
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:35,132
Go to sleep.

1251
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,721
Jj

1252
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:57,234
Damn it, homie. What the fuck
are you doing over here?

1253
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,569
Don't get your panties in a twist.
I'm not staying, okay?

1254
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:04,746
Just... listen,
how do I change it? Bitcoins.

1255
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:06,834
How do I...

1256
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:09,379
Personal or professional reasons?

1257
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:10,706
Answer the question.

1258
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:15,844
Yeah, you cross this fucking line, bowden,
there ain't no going back, yo.

1259
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:17,922
Look, I got it
under control, all right?

1260
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,756
I know they have the fucking money.

1261
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:21,413
They're not gonna notice when it's gone,

1262
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:23,769
so, just, please, answer the question.

1263
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:25,853
Give me a day.

1264
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,101
For what?

1265
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,775
To make it green, motherfucker.

1266
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,273
All right.

1267
01:22:36,243 --> 01:22:38,950
You sure about this shit, yo?

1268
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:40,743
Just change it, okay?

1269
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:44,699
Jj

1270
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,848
There is a curtain
of anonymity and secrecy

1271
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:09,557
that covers everything that goes on
behind the scenes here.

1272
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:13,860
And I have to stay constantly on the move
to keep ahead of the state.

1273
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:17,906
I know this whole market
is based on the trust you put in me,

1274
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:20,279
and I don't take that lightly.

1275
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,907
The way I see it, we are all players

1276
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:27,162
in something that has grown
beyond any of us.

1277
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:30,665
Rarely do I lift my head
long enough to take in

1278
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,667
just how amazing all of this is.

1279
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:37,923
I have no one to share my thoughts with
in physical space.

1280
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,549
Security does not permit it anymore.

1281
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:44,641
So, thanks for listening.

1282
01:23:48,232 --> 01:23:49,709
This guy's clearly self-taught.

1283
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:52,003
Even though he fixed it, we could read
the previous version underneath.

1284
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,688
Nice job, Kim. Okay.

1285
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:55,440
Goddamn it. What, bowden?

1286
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:57,396
Uh, I was told to give you this.

1287
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:59,402
Just put it somewhere.

1288
01:23:59,493 --> 01:24:03,953
Ladies and gentlemen, the ip address
of the silk road server.

1289
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:09,537
- Holy shit.
- All right, get to work.

1290
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:14,921
- Kim, do we have a physical address?
- He's hosted on a server farm in Iceland.

1291
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:17,169
Okay, I'll call the ausa,

1292
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:19,741
and within 24 hours, we'll be monitoring
this guy in real time.

1293
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:23,680
- The order for its encrypted chats, too?
- Huh?

1294
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:25,098
No. But when we bust him,

1295
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:27,847
we'll seize his laptop,
and then we'll get everything.

1296
01:24:27,938 --> 01:24:29,929
Everyone he ever dealt with.

1297
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:35,059
Iceland, you prosecute him right here
and I need to confirm now.

1298
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,861
With a little luck, we'll do it.

1299
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:55,962
Hey. I need your help with something.

1300
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:57,209
You don't knock?

1301
01:24:58,218 --> 01:25:02,006
Look, it's no secret you and I
don't see eye to eye, okay?

1302
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:03,177
- No.
- I know

1303
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:05,927
that you know that I think you're a...

1304
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,641
Well, you're a dick.

1305
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:10,890
Yeah.

1306
01:25:10,981 --> 01:25:13,142
But tarbell's a bigger dick,

1307
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:15,394
and I hear he may have found dpr.

1308
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:17,100
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1309
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:18,631
- He hasn't said anything to me.
- He wouldn't.

1310
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:20,486
But I got a source at the bureau.

1311
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:23,691
Says there's a kid ordering fake passports
in San Francisco...

1312
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:26,576
Under the name Josh terrey.

1313
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:30,121
- Josh terrey.
- Yeah.

1314
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,369
- In San Francisco.
- Yeah.

1315
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:36,170
Homeland security's got him
under 24-hour surveillance.

1316
01:25:37,716 --> 01:25:39,081
So, what do you want from me?

1317
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:42,336
You got anyone on the ground out there
who might be able to check it out for us?

1318
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:44,878
Get us in the game?

1319
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,173
But you thought boots on the ground
was 3 waste of time.

1320
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:49,599
Call it an exception, right?

1321
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:53,811
Yeah.

1322
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:57,141
Well, it's just too bad that I am a dick.

1323
01:25:58,362 --> 01:26:01,820
Real shame. Real fucking shame.

1324
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,564
Three days
sitting on this prick.

1325
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:18,829
I'm missing my kid's pony league playoffs.

1326
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:21,836
Package is on his doorstep.
It's not like he doesn't know it's there.

1327
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:24,543
- Let's jam him.
- Yes, ma'am.

1328
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:45,693
- Hey.
- Hey.

1329
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,000
- I think you have the wrong address.
- Oh, no.

1330
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:51,198
I'm nob.

1331
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:54,490
Yeah, step aside.

1332
01:26:55,836 --> 01:26:57,451
- How did you find me?
- Close the door.

1333
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:05,548
- How'd you find me?
- How fucking old are you, dude?

1334
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:07,628
- Twenty-seven.
- Yeah?

1335
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,926
- Yeah.
- You been shaving long?

1336
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:12,097
What?

1337
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:16,144
You have two federal agents
in an unmarked across the street.

1338
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,563
- They're here to arrest you for...
- Wait. What hap...

1339
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:23,610
Shh. Ordering fake passports
off the silk road. Yeah.

1340
01:27:23,697 --> 01:27:27,485
When they knock on that door,
this is what you're gonna tell 'em.

1341
01:27:32,706 --> 01:27:34,116
Joshua terrey?

1342
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:35,697
- Yeah.
- Agent Conroy.

1343
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,953
Homeland security.
This is agent Ramirez.

1344
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:39,044
This belong to you?

1345
01:27:39,129 --> 01:27:41,996
Contains fake ids and passports.

1346
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,751
Do you know anything about that?

1347
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:49,711
Can I see that for a second?

1348
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,054
Yeah.

1349
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:56,972
Shit. Well, it says right there,
"no signature required."

1350
01:27:57,063 --> 01:27:59,600
Meaning, I haven't taken possession of it.

1351
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:02,895
Which is why you knocked
instead of kicked.

1352
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:06,861
Well, anybody could have ordered that,

1353
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:10,907
you know, off the silk road, for instance.

1354
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:12,575
With your pictures?

1355
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:16,784
It's a free country. Now, um...

1356
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,412
If you'll excuse me...

1357
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:22,961
Sorry I couldn't help you guys out,
but I got some work to do.

1358
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:24,834
Have a nice day.

1359
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:36,682
- Holy fucking shit.
- Yeah.

1360
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:40,891
Now what?

1361
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:41,982
Now...

1362
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:45,437
You delete our fucking chat history.

1363
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:47,571
Yeah.

1364
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:48,736
- Like, now.
- Yeah.

1365
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,064
- Do it.
- Yeah. Just...

1366
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:57,328
You think this is a fucking game?

1367
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:02,792
- All of it.
- Yeah. Just give me a second.

1368
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:04,357
You think I'm going down cause of you?

1369
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:06,042
I ain't going down because of you.

1370
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:08,168
It's gone. It's done.

1371
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:10,462
Fucking better be.

1372
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:16,883
Next time, just don't be such a smart ass.

1373
01:29:20,814 --> 01:29:22,145
Yeah.

1374
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:31,772
Jj

1375
01:29:39,165 --> 01:29:40,746
Fuck!

1376
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:48,921
Fuck!

1377
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:03,724
Jj

1378
01:30:10,614 --> 01:30:12,842
What you doing back there, rayford?
You rubbing it out?

1379
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:17,266
You better not be fucking telling me
you lost my bitcoin, ray.

1380
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:25,992
"Don't trip.

1381
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:28,708
I got your back."

1382
01:30:39,476 --> 01:30:42,889
You motherfucking,
ingrate cocksucker. Fuck.

1383
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:47,597
The fuck is that?

1384
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:50,274
- It's 37k, yo.
- Thirty-seven k?

1385
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:52,774
Dude, I had fucking 200k
in my bitcoin wallet.

1386
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:55,509
Well, it's not my fault that bitcoin been
going up and down and shit.

1387
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:58,070
It's fucking volatile.

1388
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:00,439
Won't even fucking last me a year.

1389
01:31:01,414 --> 01:31:03,575
Tuition's 40 fucking grand.

1390
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:07,751
- Motherfucker. Unbelievable.
- Forty fucking grand?

1391
01:31:07,837 --> 01:31:10,749
I thought your kid
was in pre-school, yo. Shit.

1392
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:15,008
I don't care. Gonna see how much time
we got to negotiate.

1393
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:19,262
Tarbell.

1394
01:31:19,349 --> 01:31:21,055
Any word from the Icelandic embassy?

1395
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:22,928
My guys are heading
to Reykjavik in an hour.

1396
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:24,259
When it goes, it goes fast.

1397
01:31:24,354 --> 01:31:26,310
How long until his servers are mirrored?

1398
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:28,167
Twelve hours from when they hit
the Thor data center.

1399
01:31:28,191 --> 01:31:30,933
And it's what, seven, eight hours flight?

1400
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:32,688
- What are you, a travel agent?
- No, man.

1401
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:34,006
Just seeing if you need any backup.

1402
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:36,817
Negative, bowden. Fucking guy.

1403
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:41,072
- We got 19 hours.
- Then what?

1404
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:45,200
Then I take care of my family.

1405
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:48,249
Set up a new user profile for me,
friendly chemist.

1406
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:50,201
Shit. Bowden,
you know something, huh?

1407
01:31:50,296 --> 01:31:51,581
Hmm.

1408
01:31:52,632 --> 01:31:55,465
He wants to fuck me in the ass,
he can pay for the privilege.

1409
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:11,355
Fucking bullshit.

1410
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:20,991
No. No. No. Piece of shit.

1411
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:24,069
Ah. I'm gonna send you something, okay?

1412
01:32:24,164 --> 01:32:25,950
Send him this.

1413
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:30,034
Is that his fucking ip address, yo?

1414
01:32:30,128 --> 01:32:31,459
That'll wake him up.

1415
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:40,380
Shit.

1416
01:32:40,472 --> 01:32:42,463
Jj

1417
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,403
What's so funny, dude?

1418
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:01,732
We're on a fucking stakeout,
you know, right?

1419
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:03,429
Well, it's more like
a shakedown, remember?

1420
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:04,613
I guess so.

1421
01:33:09,918 --> 01:33:11,704
Fuck, yeah, I do international jobs.

1422
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:15,878
Friendly fucking chemist
from British Columbia.

1423
01:33:15,965 --> 01:33:17,818
I think I might know
a biker up there

1424
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:19,332
who could take care of business.

1425
01:33:21,137 --> 01:33:24,675
I want you to set up another user profile,
redwhiteandblue.

1426
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:27,348
Fucking bowden, a stone-cold criminal.

1427
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:29,892
When the fuck you learn how to do that?

1428
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:32,391
Hey, it's cally. Uh...

1429
01:33:32,482 --> 01:33:35,224
We are here at the restaurant,
and it is beautiful.

1430
01:33:35,318 --> 01:33:37,775
And I have no idea
where you are.

1431
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:41,487
Dad is getting really hungry.
Please hurry. Okay, love you, bye.

1432
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:43,860
We're on major jet lag.

1433
01:33:44,661 --> 01:33:46,322
Hey, sorry I'm late.

1434
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:49,154
- Hi, sweetheart. Hi.
- Hey.

1435
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:52,657
- You look great.
- You look stressed.

1436
01:33:52,752 --> 01:33:54,993
Oh, no. It's just work stuff, you know?

1437
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:57,920
How was the flight? Oh.

1438
01:33:58,925 --> 01:34:00,965
I don't know why
you wasted money on business class.

1439
01:34:03,972 --> 01:34:08,386
Uh... well, reservation's
under my name. Ulbricht.

1440
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:11,179
Follow me.

1441
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:12,761
Listen, I'll see you guys in there.

1442
01:34:12,856 --> 01:34:13,856
- Okay?
- Okay.

1443
01:34:14,732 --> 01:34:16,438
- You doing okay?
- Yeah.

1444
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:19,817
- You sure?
- Yeah. No, I'm good.

1445
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,691
- Okay.
- Don't leave me stranded.

1446
01:34:27,954 --> 01:34:29,945
Jj

1447
01:34:40,383 --> 01:34:43,466
Cold, bitch. Cold.

1448
01:34:43,553 --> 01:34:46,590
- Please.
- Fuck, dude.

1449
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:50,219
Fucker, hit him back, dude.

1450
01:35:04,616 --> 01:35:07,733
- We can just order.
- No. Let's wait for him.

1451
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:09,818
Jj

1452
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:38,850
We got him. Let's go.

1453
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:42,141
Checkmate, motherfucker.

1454
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:51,902
- Here he comes. We'll wait.
- I'm sorry about that.

1455
01:35:53,122 --> 01:35:56,239
Work's been, uh... crazy.

1456
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:00,326
Hey.

1457
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:05,506
I'm really proud of you
and how hard you're working.

1458
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:10,386
I guess you found the thing.

1459
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:14,261
Yeah.

1460
01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:20,389
Jj

1461
01:37:17,248 --> 01:37:19,660
How the fuck do you eat that shit, yo?

1462
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:21,312
The fuck you got against bear claws, huh?

1463
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:22,792
Fucking disgusting.

1464
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:26,542
Don't even got a fucking half-and-half
at this bullshit-ass donut shop.

1465
01:37:26,632 --> 01:37:28,372
The fuck is this?

1466
01:37:28,468 --> 01:37:30,959
You call me out here to watch you
eat a fucking bear claw?

1467
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:38,591
I want you to give that to Sandy.

1468
01:37:45,401 --> 01:37:47,608
You could still get out
from under this, right?

1469
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:49,151
Right.

1470
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:52,480
Tired, man.

1471
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:55,570
"Tired, man."

1472
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:59,032
Don't give up, Rick.

1473
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:01,034
You know, man...

1474
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:03,787
I was wrong about you.

1475
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:07,128
You are a friend.

1476
01:38:10,802 --> 01:38:12,042
Don't let me down.

1477
01:38:14,305 --> 01:38:16,296
Jj

1478
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:39,577
He's on the move. Got his laptop with him.

1479
01:38:39,664 --> 01:38:41,029
Which way is he coming?

1480
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:43,869
Right at you.

1481
01:38:44,877 --> 01:38:46,083
Fuck.

1482
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:52,631
How can I help you?

1483
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:55,130
- Iced tea, please.
- Sure. It'll be $3.

1484
01:39:01,227 --> 01:39:03,684
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

1485
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:16,606
On him.

1486
01:39:17,785 --> 01:39:22,154
Blue hoodie, jeans, flip-flops, on foot,
westbound towards target location.

1487
01:39:22,248 --> 01:39:24,534
I'm letting him go,
confirm when you have a visual.

1488
01:39:28,838 --> 01:39:31,295
For years, I was frustrated

1489
01:39:31,382 --> 01:39:33,589
by what seemed to be
the insurmountable barriers

1490
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:38,136
between the world as it is
and the world I wanted.

1491
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:40,634
So, I began making a website

1492
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:43,683
where people could buy
and sell anything anonymously.

1493
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:47,887
I built it because I think
the pursuit of freedom

1494
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:50,348
is the most hoble human endeavor.

1495
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,351
I knew the state might try to impede it,

1496
01:39:53,446 --> 01:39:56,028
but if we never try
for fear of retribution,

1497
01:39:56,115 --> 01:39:57,776
we have already lost, you know?

1498
01:39:59,202 --> 01:40:01,318
Silk road is about
something much bigger

1499
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:03,573
than thumbing your nose at the man.

1500
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:08,287
It's about taking back our Liberty.

1501
01:40:08,377 --> 01:40:12,370
And as corny as it sounds,
I just wanna look back at my life

1502
01:40:12,465 --> 01:40:15,127
and know that I did something
that helped people.

1503
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:24,599
Nobody moves until my go.
He doesn't log in, we abort.

1504
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:26,095
And I repeat,

1505
01:40:26,187 --> 01:40:29,179
if he closes the laptop,
data's encrypted and we got shit.

1506
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:31,834
Everybody calm the fuck down.

1507
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:33,779
Just calm the fuck down.
We got this. Here we go.

1508
01:40:33,819 --> 01:40:35,901
Okay, let's get the reception on one.

1509
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:38,300
Uh, I wanna see surveillance perimeter
on three right there.

1510
01:40:38,324 --> 01:40:40,656
Uh, yeah, pump that over.
Okay, we're good.

1511
01:40:40,743 --> 01:40:43,655
Let's zoom in there.
Yeah, that's good. Yeah.

1512
01:40:43,746 --> 01:40:45,282
We got him, huh?

1513
01:40:45,373 --> 01:40:47,204
Shit's going down
right now. Shush.

1514
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:49,282
Everybody, ready? Here we go.
Let's get him.

1515
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:54,458
- Hold, hold.
- The mic on ghost 2 isn't on.

1516
01:40:54,549 --> 01:40:56,505
The fuck are these guys doing?

1517
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:58,695
What the fuck kind of Mickey mouse
operation is this shit?

1518
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:02,132
The fuck, tarbell!
All right, good on visual.

1519
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:06,899
Ghost 2, hold your position.

1520
01:41:15,945 --> 01:41:17,310
Hey, who the fuck is calling him?

1521
01:41:22,285 --> 01:41:23,741
Hello?

1522
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:25,159
Hey, kid, listen.

1523
01:41:26,163 --> 01:41:28,870
When you hit 50,
and life hasn't turned out

1524
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:30,769
quite the way you thought
it would when you were 28,

1525
01:41:30,793 --> 01:41:32,704
I want you to remember one thing.

1526
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:36,504
I got to you first, smart ass.

1527
01:41:36,591 --> 01:41:38,582
Jj

1528
01:41:48,311 --> 01:41:51,474
Do it, you son of a bitch.
Come on. Log in.

1529
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:06,279
And...

1530
01:42:11,751 --> 01:42:12,991
Now.

1531
01:42:14,337 --> 01:42:16,373
I ow-life cocksucker!

1532
01:42:17,715 --> 01:42:19,296
- Hey.
- Freeze, motherfucker.

1533
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:20,903
Back away from the table now.

1534
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:22,458
Put your hands up. Go.

1535
01:42:24,889 --> 01:42:27,489
- Stay right there.
- Turn around and face me.

1536
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:32,039
- Do not move.
- Head down.

1537
01:42:32,063 --> 01:42:34,554
- I repeat, do not move.
- Head down.

1538
01:42:37,777 --> 01:42:39,417
Stay where you are. Nobody move.

1539
01:42:40,237 --> 01:42:42,569
Stay right there, sir.
Do not move.

1540
01:42:42,657 --> 01:42:44,443
Hands up. Head down.

1541
01:42:44,533 --> 01:42:47,900
Head down. Keep moving.
Head down. Turn around.

1542
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:51,954
Turn around! On your knees.
On your knees, now!

1543
01:42:53,626 --> 01:42:55,162
Let me call you back.

1544
01:42:58,005 --> 01:42:59,040
Just fucking...

1545
01:43:00,049 --> 01:43:03,416
When they come... when they come,
and they will come,

1546
01:43:04,428 --> 01:43:07,228
some millennial asshole who thinks
he can do the job better than you...

1547
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:09,993
I'm not talking about shields,
I'm not talking about the DEA.

1548
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:11,132
I'm talking about America.

1549
01:43:11,227 --> 01:43:13,513
This whole country is overrun
by these little assholes.

1550
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:15,724
And everything they know,
they learned off a screen...

1551
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:18,939
Not staring down the barrel of a gun.

1552
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:23,652
Experience matters, Johnny.

1553
01:43:23,739 --> 01:43:25,821
And you, above all people,
should know that.

1554
01:43:26,826 --> 01:43:30,910
You got a whole building full of us old
war horses here. So when they come...

1555
01:43:30,996 --> 01:43:34,864
- Bowden! Bowden!
- It's your job to protect them.

1556
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:37,666
Bowden! Bowden!

1557
01:43:38,671 --> 01:43:40,536
Don't let that cunt cuff me.

1558
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:46,133
Rick, turn around. Hands up.

1559
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:48,211
Hands where I can see em.
You're under arrest.

1560
01:43:49,432 --> 01:43:53,175
Ross ulbricht, you're under arrest
for narcotics trafficking,

1561
01:43:53,269 --> 01:43:56,136
money laundering and conspiracy.

1562
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:00,856
It's over, son.

1563
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:06,896
Jj

1564
01:44:24,592 --> 01:44:25,877
You okay?

1565
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:29,798
Yeah.

1566
01:44:29,889 --> 01:44:30,949
- You look good.
- Yeah.

1567
01:44:30,973 --> 01:44:32,713
You, too.

1568
01:44:32,808 --> 01:44:34,924
- Yeah? You're just saying that?
- No. Mm-hmm.

1569
01:44:38,981 --> 01:44:40,061
Is she here?

1570
01:44:41,066 --> 01:44:43,227
- Yeah. Yeah, she's in there.
- Yeah?

1571
01:44:43,319 --> 01:44:47,028
- I, um, wanted to talk to you first.
- Okay.

1572
01:44:47,114 --> 01:44:48,524
Did you, uh...

1573
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:51,194
Did you...

1574
01:44:57,666 --> 01:44:59,657
Jj

1575
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:03,957
Yeah, we got it.

1576
01:45:11,597 --> 01:45:14,885
Listen, you are always
gonna be Edie's father.

1577
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:21,679
Well?

1578
01:45:28,864 --> 01:45:32,777
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I don't know.

1579
01:45:46,465 --> 01:45:48,626
- Hey.
- Hey.

1580
01:45:48,717 --> 01:45:49,797
Hey.

1581
01:45:51,637 --> 01:45:54,470
Hey. Oh, peanut.

1582
01:45:54,557 --> 01:45:55,592
Hi, dada.

1583
01:45:57,184 --> 01:45:58,469
So?

1584
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:06,102
Oh, my gosh. Wow.
Look at that, huh?

1585
01:46:06,193 --> 01:46:10,482
Mom, you're seeing that?
Huh? Is it matching?

1586
01:46:10,573 --> 01:46:12,484
- No?
- I made it my own way.

1587
01:46:14,285 --> 01:46:17,368
Good girl, peanut. Good girl.

1588
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:21,869
So, new school, huh? Excited?

1589
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:26,418
Nervous? Little?
No, you're not nervous, are you?

1590
01:46:26,505 --> 01:46:28,712
No, you're my big tiger, aren't you?

1591
01:46:28,799 --> 01:46:32,087
There you go. Huh?

1592
01:46:34,263 --> 01:46:36,504
They're probably gonna
tell you some things, peanut.

1593
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:39,744
They're gonna tell you...
You're gonna hear some things,

1594
01:46:39,768 --> 01:46:41,929
you know, say things like,
you know, life is...

1595
01:46:43,772 --> 01:46:45,558
Life is not always black and white,

1596
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:48,265
but, you know, things are
more complicated than that.

1597
01:46:49,278 --> 01:46:50,984
Okay?

1598
01:46:51,071 --> 01:46:55,690
But here's the truth. Okay?

1599
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:02,617
There's good and bad in this world.

1600
01:47:03,876 --> 01:47:06,333
And, uh, sometimes
you gofta make a choice,

1601
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:07,785
you gotta pick a side, okay?

1602
01:47:11,383 --> 01:47:13,749
I won't always be there to tell you this...

1603
01:47:17,264 --> 01:47:18,754
But you are loved.

1604
01:47:23,646 --> 01:47:25,637
I love you, dada.

1605
01:47:25,731 --> 01:47:27,722
Jj

1606
01:47:47,378 --> 01:47:49,334
Okay, sweetie.

1607
01:48:03,769 --> 01:48:05,760
Jj

1608
01:48:08,023 --> 01:48:10,309
Silk road was supposed to be
about giving people

1609
01:48:10,401 --> 01:48:16,112
the freedom to make their own choices,
to pursue their own happiness.

1610
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:20,817
But I learned
that when you give people freedom,

1611
01:48:21,829 --> 01:48:23,535
you don't know what they'll do with it.

1612
01:48:29,169 --> 01:48:33,788
Your honor, I know
you must take away my middle years,

1613
01:48:33,882 --> 01:48:37,466
but please leave me my old age.

1614
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:41,177
Please leave a small light
at the end of the tunnel,

1615
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:44,764
an excuse to stay healthy,

1616
01:48:44,852 --> 01:48:47,389
an excuse to dream of better days ahead

1617
01:48:47,479 --> 01:48:51,267
and a chance to redeem myself...

1618
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,146
Before I meet my maker.

1619
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:03,651
Jj
